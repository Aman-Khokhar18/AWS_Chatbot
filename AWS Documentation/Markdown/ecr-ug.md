## What is Amazon Elastic Container Registry?

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry
service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with
resource-based permissions using AWS IAM. This is so that specified users or Amazon EC2 instances
can access your container repositories and images. You can use your preferred CLI to push, pull, and
manage Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts.

**Note**

Amazon ECR supports public container image repositories as well. For more information,
[see What is Amazon ECR Public in the Amazon ECR Public User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/what-is-ecr.html)

The AWS container services team maintains a public roadmap on GitHub. It contains information
about what the teams are working on and allows all AWS customers the ability to give direct
[feedback. For more information, see AWS Containers Roadmap.](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap)

### Concepts and components of Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry service provided by AWS. It allows
you to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images securely and reliably. These concepts
and components work together to provide a secure, scalable, and reliable Docker container
registry service within the AWS, enabling you to efficiently manage and deploy your containerized
applications.

Here are some key concepts and components of Amazon ECR:

**Registry**

An Amazon ECR registry is a private repository provided to each AWS account, where you can
create one or more repositories. These repositories allow you to store and distribute Docker
images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and other OCI-compatible artifacts within your
AWS environment. For more information, see Amazon ECR private registry.

**Authorization token**

Your client must authenticate to an Amazon ECR private registry as an AWS user before it can
push and pull images. For more information, see Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR.

Concepts and components API Version 2015-09-21 1


-----

**Repository**

A repository in Amazon ECR is a logical collection where you can store your Docker images,
Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and other OCI-compatible artifacts. Within a single
Amazon ECR registry, you can have multiple repositories to organize your container images. For
more information, see Amazon ECR private repositories.

**Repository policy**

You can control access to your repositories and the contents within them with repository
policies. For more information, see Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

**Image**

You can push and pull container images to your repositories. You can use these images locally
on your development system, or you can use them in Amazon ECS task definitions and Amazon
EKS pod specifications. For more information, see Using Amazon ECR images with Amazon ECS
and Using Amazon ECR Images with Amazon EKS.

**Lifecycle Policy**

Amazon ECR lifecycle policies allow you to manage the lifecycle of your images by defining
rules for pruning and expiring old or unused images. For more information, see Automate the
cleanup of images by using lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR.

**Image Scanning**

Amazon ECR provides an integrated image scanning capability that helps identify software
vulnerabilities in your container images. For more information, see Scan images for software

vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR.

**Access Control**

Amazon ECR uses IAM to control access to your repositories. You can create IAM users, groups,
and roles with specific permissions to push, pull, or manage Amazon ECR repositories. For more
information, see Security in Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

**Cross-account and Cross-region Replication**

Amazon ECR supports replicating images across multiple AWS accounts and regions for
increased availability and reduced latency. For more information, see Private image replication
in Amazon ECR.

Concepts and components API Version 2015-09-21 2


-----

**Encryption**

Amazon ECR supports server-side encryption of your Docker images at rest using AWS KMS. For
more information, see Data protection in Amazon ECR.

**AWS Command Line Interface Integration**

The AWS CLI provides commands to interact with Amazon ECR repositories, such as creating,
listing, pushing, and pulling images.

**AWS Management Console**

Amazon ECR can also be managed through the AWS Management Console, providing a userfriendly web interface for working with your repositories and images.

**AWS CloudTrail**

Amazon ECR integrates with AWS CloudTrail, allowing you to log and audit API calls made to

Amazon ECR for security and compliance purposes. For more information, see Logging Amazon
ECR actions with AWS CloudTrail.

**Amazon CloudWatch**

Amazon ECR provides metrics and logs that can be monitored using Amazon CloudWatch,
enabling you to track the performance and usage of your Amazon ECR repositories. For more
information, see Amazon ECR repository metrics.

### Common use cases in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR is a fully-managed Docker container registry service offered by AWS. It provides a
secure and scalable repository for storing and distributing Docker container images, making it an
essential component in containerized application deployments. Amazon ECR simplifies the process
of building, distributing, and running containerized applications across various AWS services and
on-premises environments.

Here are some key use cases for Amazon ECR:

**Container Image Storage and Distribution**

Amazon ECR serves as a centralized repository for storing and distributing Docker container
images within an organization or for public consumption. Developers can push their container
images to Amazon ECR and then pull them from any compute environment within AWS, such

Common use cases API Version 2015-09-21 3


-----

as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, or Amazon EKS. For more information, see Amazon ECR private
repositories.

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

Amazon ECR integrates seamlessly with AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, and other CI/CD
tools, enabling automated building, testing, and deployment of containerized applications.
Container images can be automatically pushed to Amazon ECR as part of the CI/CD pipeline,
ensuring consistent and reliable deployment across different environments.

**Microservices Architecture**

Amazon ECR is well suited for microservices architectures, where applications are broken down
into smaller, decoupled services packaged as containers. Each microservice can have its own
container image stored in Amazon ECR, enabling independent development, deployment, and
scaling of individual services.

**Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments**

Amazon ECR supports the ability to pull container images from other container registries,
such as Docker Hub or third party registries. This allows organizations to maintain a consistent
deployment model across hybrid or multi-cloud environments, using Amazon ECR as the central
repository for container images.

**Access Control and Security**

Amazon ECR provides fine-grained access control mechanisms, allowing organizations to
control who can push or pull container images from the registry. It also integrates with AWS
Identity and Access Management for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access
to container images. For more information, see Security in Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

**Image Vulnerability Scanning**

Amazon ECR offers automatic scanning of container images for software vulnerabilities and
potential misconfiguration, helping to maintain a secure and compliant container environment.
For more information, see Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR.

**Private Container Registry**

For organizations with strict security or compliance requirements, Amazon ECR can be used
as a private container registry, ensuring that sensitive container images are not exposed to
public registries and are accessible only within the organization's AWS environment. For more
information, see Amazon ECR private registry.

Common use cases API Version 2015-09-21 4


-----

**Globally Distributed Application Deployment with Amazon ECR Replication**

Leveraging Amazon ECR replication capability, you can centralize your containerized web
application images in a primary repository, enabling automated distribution across multiple
AWS regions, ensuring consistent global deployments with low latency worldwide and reducing
operational burden. For more information, see Private image replication in Amazon ECR

**Automated Cleanup of Stale Container Images**

Amazon ECR lifecycle policies enable automated cleanup of stale container images based on
defined rules such as age, count, or tags, optimizing storage costs, maintaining an organized
registry, enhancing security and compliance, and streamlining development workflows through
automation. For more information, see Automate the cleanup of images by using lifecycle
policies in Amazon ECR

### Features of Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR provides the following features:

- Lifecycle policies help with managing the lifecycle of the images in your repositories. You define

rules that result in the cleaning up of unused images. You can test rules before applying them
to your repository. For more information, see Automate the cleanup of images by using lifecycle
policies in Amazon ECR.

- Image scanning helps in identifying software vulnerabilities in your container images. Each

repository can be configured to scan on push. This ensures that each new image pushed to the
repository is scanned. You can then retrieve the results of the image scan. For more information,

see Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR.

- Cross-Region and cross-account replication makes it easier for you to have your images where

you need them. This is configured as a registry setting and is on a per-Region basis. For more
information, see Private registry settings in Amazon ECR.

- Pull through cache rules provide a way to cache repositories in an upstream registry in your

private Amazon ECR registry. Using a pull through cache rule, Amazon ECR will periodically reach
out to the upstream registry to ensure the cached image in your Amazon ECR private registry
is up to date. For more information, see Sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private
registry.

### How to get started with Amazon ECR

If you are using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
Service (Amazon EKS), note that the setup for those two services is similar to the setup for Amazon
ECR because Amazon ECR is an extension of both services.

When using the AWS Command Line Interface with Amazon ECR, use a version of the AWS CLI that
supports the latest Amazon ECR features. If you don't see support for an Amazon ECR feature in
the AWS CLI, upgrade to the latest version of the AWS CLI. For information about installing the
[latest version of the AWS CLI, see Install or update to the latest version of the AWS CLI in the AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
_Command Line Interface User Guide._

To learn how to push a container image to a private Amazon ECR repository using the AWS CLI and
Docker, see Moving an image through its lifecycle in Amazon ECR.

### Pricing for Amazon ECR

With Amazon ECR, you only pay for the amount of data you store in your repositories and for the
[data transfer from your image pushes and pulls. For more information, see Amazon ECR pricing.](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing/)

How to get started with Amazon ECR API Version 2015-09-21 6


-----

## Moving an image through its lifecycle in Amazon ECR

If you are using Amazon ECR for the first time, use the following steps with the Docker CLI and
the AWS CLI to create a sample image, authenticate to the default registry, and create a private
repository. Then push an image to and pull an image from the private repository. When you are
finished with the sample image, delete the sample image and the repository.

To use the AWS Management Console instead of the AWS CLI, see the section called âCreating a
repository to store imagesâ.

For more information on the other tools available for managing your AWS resources, including the
[different AWS SDKs, IDE toolkits, and the Windows PowerShell command line tools, see http://](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/)
[aws.amazon.com/tools/.](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/)

### Prerequisites

If you do not have the latest AWS CLI and Docker installed and ready to use, use the following
steps to install both of these tools.

#### Install the AWS CLI

To use the AWS CLI with Amazon ECR, install the latest AWS CLI version. For information, see
[Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

#### Install Docker

Docker is available on many different operating systems, including most modern Linux
distributions, like Ubuntu, and even macOS and Windows. For more information about how to
[install Docker on your particular operating system, go to the Docker installation guide.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#installation)

You do not need a local development system to use Docker. If you are using Amazon EC2 already,
you can launch an Amazon Linux 2023 instance and install Docker to get started.

If you already have Docker installed, skip to Step 1: Create a Docker image.

**To install Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance using an Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**

1. Launch an instance with the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI. For more information, see
[Launching an instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html)

   sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

```
7. Log out and log back in again to pick up the new docker group permissions. You can
accomplish this by closing your current SSH terminal window and reconnecting to your

instance in a new one. Your new SSH session will have the appropriate docker group
permissions.

8. Verify that the ec2-user can run Docker commands without sudo.
```
   docker info

```
**Note**

In some cases, you may need to reboot your instance to provide permissions for the
```
     ec2-user to access the Docker daemon. Try rebooting your instance if you see the

```
following error:
```
      Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this
       host?

```

-----

### Step 1: Create a Docker image

In this step, you create a Docker image of a simple web application, and test it on your local system
or Amazon EC2 instance.

**To create a Docker image of a simple web application**

1. Create a file called Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a manifest that describes the base image
to use for your Docker image and what you want installed and running on it. For more
[information about Dockerfiles, go to the Dockerfile Reference.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
```
   touch Dockerfile

```
2. Edit the Dockerfile you just created and add the following content.
```
   FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest
   # Install dependencies
   RUN yum update -y && \
    yum install -y httpd
   # Install apache and write hello world message
   RUN echo 'Hello World!' > /var/www/html/index.html
   # Configure apache
   RUN echo 'mkdir -p /var/run/httpd' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \
    echo 'mkdir -p /var/lock/httpd' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \
    echo '/usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \
    chmod 755 /root/run_apache.sh
   EXPOSE 80
   CMD /root/run_apache.sh

```
This Dockerfile uses the public Amazon Linux 2 image hosted on Amazon ECR Public. The RUN
instructions update the package caches, installs some software packages for the web server,

and then write the "Hello World!" content to the web servers document root. The EXPOSE

instruction exposes port 80 on the container, and the CMD instruction starts the web server.

3. Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile.

Step 1: Create a Docker image API Version 2015-09-21 9


-----

**Note**

Some versions of Docker may require the full path to your Dockerfile in the following
command, instead of the relative path shown below.


4. List your container image.
```
   docker images --filter reference=hello-world

```
Output:
```
   REPOSITORY     TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED      
    SIZE
   hello-world     latest       e9ffedc8c286    4 minutes ago   
    194MB

```
5. Run the newly built image. The -p 80:80 option maps the exposed port 80 on the container
[to port 80 on the host system. For more information about docker run, go to the Docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)
[reference.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)
```
   docker run -t -i -p 80:80 hello-world

```
**Note**

Output from the Apache web server is displayed in the terminal window. You can

ignore the "Could not reliably determine the fully qualified domain
```
     name" message.

```
6. Open a browser and point to the server that is running Docker and hosting your container.

   - If you are using an EC2 instance, this is the Public DNS value for the server, which is the

same address you use to connect to the instance with SSH. Make sure that the security group
for your instance allows inbound traffic on port 80.

[â¢ If you are running Docker locally, point your browser to http://localhost/.](http://localhost/)

Step 1: Create a Docker image API Version 2015-09-21 10


-----

  - If you are using docker-machine on a Windows or Mac computer, find the IP address of the

VirtualBox VM that is hosting Docker with the docker-machine ip command, substituting
```
   machine-name with the name of the docker machine you are using.
    docker-machine ip machine-name

```
You should see a web page with your "Hello World!" statement.

7. Stop the Docker container by typing Ctrl + c.

### Step 2: Create a repository

Now that you have an image to push to Amazon ECR, you must create a repository to hold it. In this

example, you create a repository called hello-repository to which you later push the hello```
world:latest image. To create a repository, run the following command:
 aws ecr create-repository \
   --repository-name hello-repository \
   --region region

### Step 3: Authenticate to your default registry

```
After you have installed and configured the AWS CLI, authenticate the Docker CLI to your default
registry. That way, the docker command can push and pull images with Amazon ECR. The AWS CLI
provides a get-login-password command to simplify the authentication process.

To authenticate Docker to an Amazon ECR registry with get-login-password, run the aws ecr
**get-login-password command. When passing the authentication token to the docker login**

command, use the value AWS for the username and specify the Amazon ECR registry URI you want
to authenticate to. If authenticating to multiple registries, you must repeat the command for each
registry.

**Important**

If you receive an error, install or upgrade to the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more
[information, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

  (Get-ECRLoginCommand).Password | docker login --username AWS --password  stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

### Step 4: Push an image to Amazon ECR

```
Now you can push your image to the Amazon ECR repository you created in the previous section.
Use the docker CLI to push images after the following prerequisites are met:

- The minimum version of docker is installed: 1.7.

- The Amazon ECR authorization token was configured with docker login.

- The Amazon ECR repository exists and the user has access to push to the repository.

After those prerequisites are met, you can push your image to your newly created repository in the
default registry for your account.

**To tag and push an image to Amazon ECR**

1. List the images you have stored locally to identify the image to tag and push.
```
   docker images

```
Output:
```
   REPOSITORY     TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED      
    VIRTUAL SIZE
   hello-world     latest       e9ffedc8c286    4 minutes ago   
    241MB

```
2. Tag the image to push to your repository.

Step 4: Push an image to Amazon ECR API Version 2015-09-21 12


-----

```
docker tag hello-world:latest aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hellorepository

```

3. Push the image.
```
   docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository:latest

```
Output:
```
   The push refers to a repository [aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello   repository] (len: 1)
   e9ae3c220b23: Pushed
   a6785352b25c: Pushed
   0998bf8fb9e9: Pushed
   0a85502c06c9: Pushed
   latest: digest: sha256:215d7e4121b30157d8839e81c4e0912606fca105775bb0636EXAMPLE
    size: 6774

### Step 5: Pull an image from Amazon ECR

```
After your image is pushed to your Amazon ECR repository, you can pull it from other locations.
Use the docker CLI to pull images after the following prerequisites are met:

- The minimum version of docker is installed: 1.7.

- The Amazon ECR authorization token was configured with docker login.

- The Amazon ECR repository exists and the user has access to pull from the repository.

After those prerequisites are met, you can pull your image. To pull your example image from
Amazon ECR, run the following command:
```
 docker pull aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository:latest

```
Output:
```
 latest: Pulling from hello-repository
 0a85502c06c9: Pull complete
 0998bf8fb9e9: Pull complete

```
Step 5: Pull an image from Amazon ECR API Version 2015-09-21 13


-----

```
a6785352b25c: Pull complete
e9ae3c220b23: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:215d7e4121b30157d8839e81c4e0912606fca105775bb0636EXAMPLE
Status: Downloaded newer image for aws_account_id.dkr.region.amazonaws.com/hellorepository:latest

```

### Step 6: Delete an image

If you no longer need an image in one of your repositories, you can delete the image. To delete

an image, specify the repository that it's in and either an imageTag or imageDigest value for

the image. The following example deletes an image in the hello-repository repository with

the image tag latest. To delete your example image from the repository, run the following
command:
```
 aws ecr batch-delete-image \
    --repository-name hello-repository \
    --image-ids imageTag=latest \
    --region region

### Step 7: Delete a repository

```
If you no longer need an entire repository of images, you can delete the repository. The following

example uses the --force flag to delete a repository that contains images. To delete a repository
that contains images (and all the images within it), run the following command:
```
 aws ecr delete-repository \
    --repository-name hello-repository \
    --force \
    --region region

```

## Optimizing performance for Amazon ECR

You can use the following recommendations about settings and strategies to optimize
performance when using Amazon ECR.

Use Docker 1.10 and above to take advantage of simultaneous layer uploads

Docker images are composed of layers, which are intermediate build stages of the image. Each
line in a Dockerfile results in the creation of a new layer. When you use Docker 1.10 and above,
Docker defaults to pushing as many layers as possible as simultaneous uploads to Amazon ECR,
resulting in faster upload times.

Use a smaller base image

The default images available through Docker Hub may contain many dependencies that your
application doesn't require. Consider using a smaller image created and maintained by others in
the Docker community, or build your own base image using Docker's minimal scratch image. For
[more information, see Create a base image in the Docker documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/baseimages/)

Place the dependencies that change the least earlier in your Dockerfile

Docker caches layers, and that speeds up build times. If nothing on a layer has changed since
the last build, Docker uses the cached version instead of rebuilding the layer. However, each
layer is dependent on the layers that came before it. If a layer changes, Docker recompiles not
only that layer, but any layers that come after that layer as well.

To minimize the time required to rebuild a Dockerfile and to re-upload layers, consider placing

the dependencies that change the least frequently earlier in your Dockerfile. Place rapidly
changing dependencies (such as your application's source code) later in the stack.

Chain commands to avoid unnecessary file storage

Intermediate files created on a layer remain a part of that layer even if they are deleted in a
subsequent layer. Consider the following example:
```
   WORKDIR /tmp
   RUN wget http://example.com/software.tar.gz 
   RUN wget tar -xvf software.tar.gz 
   RUN mv software/binary /opt/bin/myapp
   RUN rm software.tar.gz

```
API Version 2015-09-21 15


-----

In this example, the layers created by the first and second RUN commands contain the
original .tar.gz file and all of its unzipped contents. This is even though the .tar.gz file is deleted
by the fourth RUN command. These commands can be chained together into a single RUN
statement to ensure that these unnecessary files aren't part of the final Docker image:
```
   WORKDIR /tmp
   RUN wget http://example.com/software.tar.gz &&\
     wget tar -xvf software.tar.gz &&\
     mv software/binary /opt/bin/myapp &&\
     rm software.tar.gz                

```
Use the closest regional endpoint

You can reduce latency in pulling images from Amazon ECR by ensuring that you are using the
regional endpoint closest to where your application is running. If your application is running
on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can use the following shell code to obtain the region from the
Availability Zone of the instance:
```
   REGION=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone
   |\
     sed -n 's/\(\d*\)[a-zA-Z]*$/\1/p')                  

```
The region can be passed to AWS CLI commands using the --region parameter, or set as the
default region for a profile using the aws configure command. You can also set the region when
making calls using the AWS SDK. For more information, see the documentation for the SDK for
your specific programming language.

## Amazon ECR private registry

An Amazon ECR private registry hosts your container images in a highly available and scalable
architecture. You can use your private registry to manage private image repositories consisting of
Docker and Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and artifacts. Each AWS account is provided
with a default private Amazon ECR registry. For more information about Amazon ECR public
[registries, see Public registries in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html)

### Private registry concepts

- The URL for your default private registry is
```
 https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com.

```
- By default, your account has read and write access to the repositories in your private registry.

However, users require permissions to make calls to the Amazon ECR APIs and to push or pull
images to and from your private repositories. Amazon ECR provides several managed policies
to control user access at varying levels. For more information, see Amazon Elastic Container
Registry Identity-based policy examples.

- You must authenticate your Docker client to your private registry so that you can use the docker

**push and docker pull commands to push and pull images to and from the repositories in that**
registry. For more information, see Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR.

- Private repositories can be controlled with both user access policies and repository policies. For

more information about repository policies, see Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

- The repositories in your private registry can be replicated across Regions in your own private

registry and across separate accounts by configuring replication for your private registry. For
more information, see Private image replication in Amazon ECR.

### Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR

You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs to create and manage
private repositories. You can also use those methods to perform some actions on images, such as
listing or deleting them. These clients use standard AWS authentication methods. Even though you
can use the Amazon ECR API to push and pull images, you're more likely to use the Docker CLI or a
language-specific Docker library.

Registry concepts API Version 2015-09-21 17


-----

The Docker CLI doesn't support native IAM authentication methods. Additional steps must be taken
so that Amazon ECR can authenticate and authorize Docker push and pull requests.

The registry authentication methods that are detailed in the following sections are available.

#### Using the Amazon ECR credential helper

Amazon ECR provides a Docker credential helper which makes it easier to store and use Docker
credentials when pushing and pulling images to Amazon ECR. For installation and configuration
[steps, see Amazon ECR Docker Credential Helper.](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper)

**Note**

The Amazon ECR Docker credential helper doesn't support multi-factor authentication
(MFA) currently.

#### Using an authorization token

An authorization token's permission scope matches that of the IAM principal used to retrieve the
authentication token. An authentication token is used to access any Amazon ECR registry that your
IAM principal has access to and is valid for 12 hours. To obtain an authorization token, you must
[use the GetAuthorizationToken API operation to retrieve a base64-encoded authorization token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_GetAuthorizationToken.html)

containing the username AWS and an encoded password. The AWS CLI get-login-password
command simplifies this by retrieving and decoding the authorization token which you can then
pipe into a docker login command to authenticate.

**To authenticate Docker to an Amazon ECR private registry with get-login**

- To authenticate Docker to an Amazon ECR registry with get-login-password, run the aws ecr
**get-login-password command. When passing the authentication token to the docker login**

command, use the value AWS for the username and specify the Amazon ECR registry URI you
want to authenticate to. If authenticating to multiple registries, you must repeat the command
for each registry.

```
    (Get-ECRLoginCommand).Password | docker login --username AWS --password    stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

#### Using HTTP API authentication

```
[Amazon ECR supports the Docker Registry HTTP API. However, because Amazon ECR is a private](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/)
registry, you must provide an authorization token with every HTTP request. You can add an HTTP

authorization header using the -H option for curl and pass the authorization token provided by the
**get-authorization-token AWS CLI command.**

**To authenticate with the Amazon ECR HTTP API**

1. Retrieve an authorization token with the AWS CLI and set it to an environment variable.
```
   TOKEN=$(aws ecr get-authorization-token --output text --query
    'authorizationData[].authorizationToken')

```
2. To authenticate to the API, pass the $TOKEN variable to the -H option of curl. For example, the
following command lists the image tags in an Amazon ECR repository. For more information,
[see the Docker Registry HTTP API reference documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/)
```
   curl -i -H "Authorization: Basic $TOKEN"
    https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/v2/amazonlinux/tags/list

### Private registry settings in Amazon ECR

```
Amazon ECR uses private registry settings to configure features at the registry level. The private
registry settings are configured separately for each Region. You can use private registry settings to
configure the following features.

- Registry permissionsâA registry permissions policy provides control over the replication

and pull through cache permissions. For more information, see Private registry permissions in
Amazon ECR.

- Pull through cache rulesâA pull through cache rule is used to cache images from an upstream

registry in your Amazon ECR private registry. For more information, see Sync an upstream
registry with an Amazon ECR private registry.

- Replication configurationâThe replication configuration is used to control whether your

repositories are copied across AWS Regions or accounts. For more information, see Private image
replication in Amazon ECR

- Repository creation templatesâA repository creation template is used to define the standard

settings to apply when new repositories are created by Amazon ECR on your behalf. For example,
repositories created by a pull through cache action. For more information, see Templates to
control repositories created during a pull through cache or replication action.

- Scanning configurationâBy default, your registry is enabled for basic scanning. You may enable

enhanced scanning which provides an automated, continuous scanning mode that scans for both
operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities. For more information, see
Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR.

### Private registry permissions in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR uses a registry policy to grant permissions to an AWS principal at the private registry
level.

The scope is set by choosing the registry policy version. There are two versions with different
registry policy scope: version 1 (V1) and version 2 (V2). V2 is the expanded registry policy scope
that includes all ECR permissions. For the full list of API actions, see the _[Amazon ECR API Guide. The](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)_
V2 version is the default registry policy scope. For more information about viewing or setting your
registry policy scope, see Switching to the extended registry policy scope. For information about
general settings for your Amazon ECR private registry, see Private registry settings in Amazon ECR.

The versions are detailed as follows.

- V1 â For version 1, Amazon ECR only enforces the following permissions at the private registry

level.

 - ecr:ReplicateImage â Grants permission to another account, referred to as the source

registry, to replicate its images to your registry. This is only used for cross-account replication.

 - ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage â Grants permission to retrieve the external image and

import it to your private registry.

 - ecr:CreateRepository â Grants permission to create a repository in a private registry. This

permission is required if the repository storing either the replicated or cached images doesn't
already exist in the private registry.

- V2â For version 2, Amazon ECR allows all ECR actions in the policy and enforces the registry

policy in all ECR requests.

You can use the console or the CLI to view or change your registry policy scope.

**Note**

While it is possible to add the ecr:* action to a private registry policy, it is considered best
practice to only add the specific actions required based on the feature you're using rather
than use a wildcard.

#### Private registry policy examples for Amazon ECR

The following examples show registry permissions policy statements that you could use to control
the permissions that users have to your Amazon ECR registry.

**Note**

In each example, if the ecr:CreateRepository action is removed from your registry
policy, replication can still occur. However, for successful replication, you need to create
repositories with the same name within your account.

##### Example: Allow the root user of a source account to replicate all repositories

The following registry permissions policy allows the root user of a source account to replicate all
repositories.
```
 {
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
     {
       "Sid":"ReplicationAccessCrossAccount",
       "Effect":"Allow",
       "Principal":{
         "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::source_account_id:root"
       },
       "Action":[
         "ecr:CreateRepository",
         "ecr:ReplicateImage"
       ],
       "Resource": [
         "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:your_account_id:repository/*"

##### Example: Allow the root user of a source account to replicate all repositories with

 prefix prod-.

The following registry permissions policy allows the root user of a source account to replicate all

repositories that start with prod-.
```
 {
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
     {
       "Sid":"ReplicationAccessCrossAccount",
       "Effect":"Allow",
       "Principal":{
         "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::source_account_id:root"
       },
       "Action":[
         "ecr:CreateRepository",
         "ecr:ReplicateImage"
       ],
       "Resource": [
         "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:your_account_id:repository/prod-*"
       ]
     }
   ]
 }

#### Switching to the extended registry policy scope

```
**Important**

For new users, your registries are automatically configured to use the V2 registry policy
upon creation. There is no action for you to take. Amazon ECR doesn't recommend

reverting to the previous registry policy V1.

You can use the console or the CLI to view or change your registry policy scope.

AWS Management Console

Use the following steps to view your account settings. To view or update the registry policy
scope, see the CLI procedure on this page.

    }

#### Granting registry permissions for cross account replication in Amazon ECR

```
The cross account policy type is used to grant permissions to an AWS principal, allowing the
replication of the repositories from a source registry to your registry. By default, you have
permission to configure cross-Region replication within your own registry. You only need to
configure the registry policy if you're granting another account permission to replicate contents to
your registry.

A registry policy must grant permission for the ecr:ReplicateImage API action. This API is an
internal Amazon ECR API that can replicate images between Regions or accounts. You can also

grant permission for the ecr:CreateRepository permission, which allows Amazon ECR to

create repositories in your registry if they don't exist already. If the ecr:CreateRepository
permission isn't provided, a repository with the same name as the source repository must be
created manually in your registry. If neither is done, replication fails. Any failed CreateRepository or
ReplicateImage API actions show up in CloudTrail.

## Amazon ECR private repositories

An Amazon ECR private repository contains your Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI)
images, and OCI compatible artifacts. You can create, monitor, and delete image repositories and
set permissions that control who can access them by using Amazon ECR API operations or the
**Repositories section of the Amazon ECR console. Amazon ECR also integrates with the Docker CLI,**
so that you can push and pull images from your development environments to your repositories.

**Topics**

- Private repository concepts

- Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images

- Viewing the contents and details of a private repository in Amazon ECR

- Deleting a private repository in Amazon ECR

- Private repository policies in Amazon ECR

- Tagging a private repository in Amazon ECR

### Private repository concepts

- By default, your account has read and write access to the repositories in your default registry

(aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com). However, users require permissions
to make calls to the Amazon ECR APIs and to push or pull images to and from your repositories.
Amazon ECR provides several managed policies to control user access at varying levels. For more
information, see Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy examples.

- Repositories can be controlled with both user access policies and individual repository policies.

For more information, see Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

- Repository names can support namespaces, which you can use to group similar repositories.

For example, if there are several teams using the same registry, Team A can use the team-a

namespace, and Team B can use the team-b namespace. By doing this, each team has their own

image called web-app with each image prefaced with the team namespace. This configuration
allows these images on each team to be used simultaneously without interference. Team A's

image is team-a/web-app, and Team B's image is team-b/web-app.

- Your images can be replicated to other repositories across Regions in your own registry and

across accounts. You can do this by specifying a replication configuration in your registry
settings. For more information, see Private registry settings in Amazon ECR.

### Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images

**Important**

Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS (DSSE-KMS) is only available in the AWS
GovCloud (US) Regions.

Create an Amazon ECR private repository, and then use the repository to store your container
images. Use the following steps to create a private repository using the AWS Management Console.
For steps to create a repository using the AWS CLI, see Step 2: Create a repository.

**To create a repository (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.

3. On the Repositories page, choose Private repositories, and then choose Create repository.

4. For Repository name, enter a unique name for your repository. The repository name can be

specified on its own (for example nginx-web-app). Alternatively, it can be prepended with

a namespace to group the repository into a category (for example project-a/nginx-web```
  app).

```
**Note**

The repository name may container a maximum of 256 characters. The name
must start with a letter and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens,
underscores, periods and forward slashes. Using a double hyphen, double underscore,
or double forward slash isn't supported.

5. For Tag immutability, choose the tag mutability setting for the repository. Repositories
configured with immutable tags prevent image tags from being overwritten. For more
information, see Preventing image tags from being overwritten in Amazon ECR.

6. For Encryption configuration, choose between AES-256 or AWS KMS. For more information,
see Encryption at rest.

Creating a repository to store images API Version 2015-09-21 30


-----

a. If AWS KMS is chosen, choose between Single-layer encryption and Dual-layer encryption.
There are additional charges for using AWS KMS or Dual-layer encryption. For more
[information, see Amazon ECR Service Pricing.](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing/)

b. By default, AWS managed key with the alias aws/ecr is chosen. This key is created in your
account the first time that you create a repository with AWS KMS encryption enabled.
Select Customer managed key (advanced) to choose your own AWS KMS key. The AWS
KMS key must be in the same Region as the cluster. Select Create an AWS KMS key to
navigate to the AWS KMS console to create your own key.

7. For Image scanning settings, while you can specify the scan settings at the repository level for
basic scanning, it's best practice to specify the scan configuration at the private registry level.
Configuring the scanning settings at the private registry level enables you to choose between
enhanced scanning or basic scanning, and also allows you to define filters to specify which
repositories should be scanned.

8. Choose Create.

#### Next steps

To view the steps to push an image to your repository, select the repository and choose View push
**commands. For more information about pushing an image to your repository, see Pushing an**
image to an Amazon ECR private repository.

### Viewing the contents and details of a private repository in Amazon ECR

After you created a private repository, you can view details about the repository in the AWS
Management Console:

- Which images are stored in a repository

- Details about each image stored in the repository, including the size and SHA digest for each

image

- The scan frequency specified for the contents of the repository

- Whether the repository has an active pull through cache rule associated with it

- The encryption setting for the repository

Next steps API Version 2015-09-21 31


-----

**Note**

Starting with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses image layers before pushing
them to a V2 Docker registry. The output of the docker images command shows the
uncompressed image size. Therefore, keep in mind that Docker might return a larger image
than the image shown in the AWS Management Console.


**To view repository information (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to view.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.

4. On the Repositories page, choose the Private tab and then the repository to view.

5. On the repository detail page, the console defaults to the Images view. Use the navigation
menu to view other information about the repository.

   - Choose Summary to view the repository details and pull count data for the repository.

   - Choose Images to view information about the image tags in the repository. To view more
information about the image, select the image tag. For more information, see Viewing
image details in Amazon ECR.

If there are untagged images that you want to delete, you can select the box to the left of
the repositories to delete and choose Delete. For more information, see Deleting an image
in Amazon ECR.

   - Choose Permissions to view the repository policies that are applied to the repository. For
more information, see Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

   - Choose Lifecycle Policy to view the lifecycle policy rules that are applied to the
repository. The lifecycle events history is also viewed here. For more information, see
Automate the cleanup of images by using lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR.

   - Choose Tags to view the metadata tags that are applied to the repository.

### Deleting a private repository in Amazon ECR

If you're finished using a repository, you can delete it. When you delete a repository in the AWS
Management Console, all of the images contained in the repository are also deleted; this cannot be
undone.

**Important**

Images in the deleted repositories are also deleted. You cannot undo this operation.

**To delete a repository (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to delete.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.

4. On the Repositories page, choose the Private tab and then select the repository to delete and
choose Delete.

5. In the Delete repository_name window, verify that the selected repositories should be
deleted and choose Delete.

### Private repository policies in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR uses resource-based permissions to control access to repositories. Resource-based
permissions let you specify which users or roles have access to a repository and what actions they
can perform on the repository. By default, only the AWS account that created the repository has
access to the repository. You can apply a repository policy that allows additional access to your
repository.

#### Repository policies vs IAM policies

Amazon ECR repository policies are a subset of IAM policies that are scoped for, and specifically
used for, controlling access to individual Amazon ECR repositories. IAM policies are generally used
to apply permissions for the entire Amazon ECR service but can also be used to control access to
specific resources as well.

Both Amazon ECR repository policies and IAM policies are used when determining which actions a
specific user or role may perform on a repository. If a user or role is allowed to perform an action
through a repository policy but is denied permission through an IAM policy (or vice versa) then
the action will be denied. A user or role only needs to be allowed permission for an action through
either a repository policy or an IAM policy but not both for the action to be allowed.

**Important**

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
```
   ecr:GetAuthorizationToken API through an IAM policy before they can authenticate

```
to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR repository. Amazon ECR
provides several managed IAM policies to control user access at varying levels; for more
information, see Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy examples.

You can use either of these policy types to control access to your repositories, as shown in the
following examples.

This example shows an Amazon ECR repository policy, which allows for a specific user to describe
the repository and the images within the repository.
```
 {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
     {
       "Sid": "ECRRepositoryPolicy",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:user/username"},
       "Action": [
         "ecr:DescribeImages",
         "ecr:DescribeRepositories"
       ]
     }

```

```
  ]
}

```

This example shows an IAM policy that achieves the same goal as above, by scoping the policy to
a repository (specified by the full ARN of the repository) using the resource parameter. For more

information about Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format, see Resources.
```
 {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
     {
       "Sid": "AllowDescribeRepoImage",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
         "ecr:DescribeImages",
         "ecr:DescribeRepositories"
       ],
       "Resource": ["arn:aws:ecr:region:account-id:repository/repository-name"]
     }
   ]
 }

#### Private repository policy examples in Amazon ECR

```
**Important**

The repository policy examples on this page are meant to be applied to Amazon ECR
private repositories. They will not work properly if used with an IAM principal directly
unless modified to specify the Amazon ECR repository as the resource. For more
information on setting repository policies, see Setting a private repository policy statement
in Amazon ECR.

Amazon ECR repository policies are a subset of IAM policies that are scoped for, and specifically
used for, controlling access to individual Amazon ECR repositories. IAM policies are generally used
to apply permissions for the entire Amazon ECR service but can also be used to control access to
specific resources as well. For more information, see Repository policies vs IAM policies.

The following repository policy examples show permission statements that you could use to
control access to your Amazon ECR private repositories.

##### Example: Allow another account

The following repository policy allows a specific account to push images.

**Important**

The account you are granting permissions to must have the Region you are creating the
repository policy in enabled, otherwise an error will occur.
```
 {

     }
   ]
 }

```
The following repository policy allows some users to pull images (pull-user-1 and pull```
user-2) while providing full access to another (admin-user).

```
**Note**

For more complicated repository policies that are not currently supported in the AWS
[Management Console, you can apply the policy with the set-repository-policy AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/set-repository-policy.html)
command.

#### Setting a private repository policy statement in Amazon ECR

```
You can add an access policy statement to a repository in the AWS Management Console by
following the steps below. You can add multiple policy statements per repository. For example
policies, see Private repository policy examples in Amazon ECR.

**Important**

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
```
   ecr:GetAuthorizationToken API through an IAM policy before they can authenticate

```
to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR repository. Amazon ECR

Setting a repository policy statement API Version 2015-09-21 40


-----

provides several managed IAM policies to control user access at varying levels; for more
information, see Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy examples.


**To set a repository policy statement**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to set a policy
statement on.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.

4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository to set a policy statement on to view the
contents of the repository.

5. From the repository image list view, in the navigation pane, choose Permissions, Edit.

**Note**

If you don't see the Permissions option in the navigation pane, ensure that you are in
the repository image list view.

6. On the Edit permissions page, choose Add statement.

7. For Statement name, enter a name for the statement.

8. For Effect, choose whether the policy statement will result in an allow or an explicit deny.

9. For Principal, choose the scope to apply the policy statement to. For more information, see
[AWS JSON Policy Elements: Principal in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html)

  - You can apply the statement to all authenticated AWS users by selecting the Everyone (*)

check box.

  - For Service principal, specify the service principal name (for example,
```
   ecs.amazonaws.com) to apply the statement to a specific service.

```
  - For AWS Account IDs, specify an AWS account number (for example, 111122223333) to

apply the statement to all users under a specific AWS account. Multiple accounts can be
specified by using a comma delimited list.

Setting a repository policy statement API Version 2015-09-21 41


-----

**Important**

The account you are granting permissions to must have the Region you are creating
the repository policy in enabled, otherwise an error will occur.



  - For IAM Entities, select the roles or users under your AWS account to apply the statement

to.

**Note**

For more complicated repository policies that are not currently supported in the
[AWS Management Console, you can apply the policy with the set-repository-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/set-repository-policy.html)
AWS CLI command.

10. For Actions, choose the scope of the Amazon ECR API operations that the policy statement

should apply to from the list of individual API operations.

11. When you are finished, choose Save to set the policy.

12. Repeat the previous step for each repository policy to add.

### Tagging a private repository in Amazon ECR

To help you manage your Amazon ECR repositories, you can assign your own metadata to new
or existing Amazon ECR repositories by using AWS resource tags. For example, you could define
a set of tags for your account's Amazon ECR repositories that helps you track the owner of each
repository.

#### Tag basics

Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon ECR and are interpreted strictly as a string of
characters. Tags are not automatically assigned to your resources. You can edit tag keys and values,
and you can remove tags from a resource at any time. You can set the value of a tag to an empty
string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. If you add a tag that has the same key as an
existing tag on that resource, the new value overwrites the old value. If you delete a resource, any
tags for the resource are also deleted.

You can work with tags using the Amazon ECR console, the AWS CLI, and the Amazon ECR API.

Tagging a repository API Version 2015-09-21 42


-----

Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can control which users in your AWS
account have permission to create, edit, or delete tags. For information about tags in IAM policies,
see the section called âUsing Tag-Based Access Controlâ.

#### Tagging your resources for billing

The tags you add to your Amazon ECR repositories are helpful when reviewing cost allocation after
enabling them in your Cost & Usage Report. For more information, see Amazon ECR usage reports.

To see the cost of your combined resources, you can organize your billing information based on
resources that have the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a
specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that
application across several services. For more information about setting up a cost allocation report
[with tags, see The Monthly Cost Allocation Report in the AWS Billing User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/configurecostallocreport.html)

**Note**

If you've just enabled reporting, data for the current month is available for viewing after 24
hours.

## Private images in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR stores Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible
artifacts in private repositories. You can use the Docker CLI, or your preferred client, to push and
pull images to and from your repositories.

With Amazon ECR support for OCI v1.1, you can store and manage reference artifacts that are
[defined by the OCI Referrers API. Artifacts include signatures, Software Bill of Materials (SBoMs),](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#enabling-the-referrers-api)
Helm charts, scan results, and attestations. A set of artifacts for a container image is transferred
with that container and stored as a separate image that counts as an image consumed for your
repository.

The Signing an image stored in an Amazon ECR private repository and Deleting signatures and
other artifacts from an Amazon ECR private repository pages provide examples of how to use
[signature-related artifacts. For more information on signing container images, see Signing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/container-workflow.html)

### Pushing an image to an Amazon ECR private repository

You can push your Docker images, manifest lists, and Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and
compatible artifacts to your private repositories.

Amazon ECR also provides a way to replicate your images to other repositories. By specifying a
replication configuration in your private registry settings, you can replicate across Regions in your

own registry and across different accounts. For more information, see Private registry settings in
Amazon ECR.

#### IAM permissions for pushing an image to an Amazon ECR private repository

Users need IAM permissions to push images to Amazon ECR private repositories. Following the best
practice of granting least privilege, you can grant access to a specific repository. You can also grant
access to all repositories.

A user must authenticate to each Amazon ECR registry they want to push images to by requesting

an authorization token. Amazon ECR provides several AWS managed policies to control user access
at varying levels. For more information, see AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container
Registry.

You can also create a your own IAM policies. The following IAM policy grants the required
permissions for pushing an image to a specific repository. The repository must be specified as a full
Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
```
 {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
     {
       "Effect": "Allow",

```

#### Pushing a Docker image to an Amazon ECR private repository

```
You can push your container images to an Amazon ECR repository with the docker push command.

Pushing a Docker image API Version 2015-09-21 48


-----

Amazon ECR also supports creating and pushing Docker manifest lists that are used for multiarchitecture images. For information, see Pushing a multi-architecture image to an Amazon ECR
private repository.

**To push a Docker image to an Amazon ECR repository**

The Amazon ECR repository must exist before you push the image. For more information, see the
section called âCreating a repository to store imagesâ.

1. Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR registry to which you intend to push your
image. Authentication tokens must be obtained for each registry used, and the tokens are valid
for 12 hours. For more information, see Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR.

To authenticate Docker to an Amazon ECR registry, run the aws ecr get-login-password
command. When passing the authentication token to the docker login command, use the

value AWS for the username and specify the Amazon ECR registry URI you want to authenticate
to. If authenticating to multiple registries, you must repeat the command for each registry.

**Important**

If you receive an error, install or upgrade to the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more
[information, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
_Interface User Guide._
```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS -   password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

```
2. If your image repository doesn't exist in the registry you intend to push to yet, create it. For
more information, see Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images.

3. Identify the local image to push. Run the docker images command to list the container images
on your system.
```
   docker images

```
You can identify an image with the repository:tag value or the image ID in the resulting
command output.

Pushing a Docker image API Version 2015-09-21 49


-----

4. Tag your image with the Amazon ECR registry, repository, and
optional image tag name combination to use. The registry format is
```
  aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com. The repository name should match

```
the repository that you created for your image. If you omit the image tag, we assume that the

tag is latest.

The following example tags a local image with the ID e9ae3c220b23 as
```
  aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository:tag.
   docker tag e9ae3c220b23 aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my   repository:tag

```
5. Push the image using the docker push command:
```
   docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository:tag

```
6. (Optional) Apply any additional tags to your image and push those tags to Amazon ECR by
repeating Step 4 and Step 5.

#### Pushing a multi-architecture image to an Amazon ECR private repository

You can push multi-architecture images to an Amazon ECR repository by creating and pushing
Docker manifest lists. A manifest list is a list of images that is created by specifying one or more
image names. In most cases, the manifest list is created from images that serve the same function
but are for different operating systems or architectures. The manifest list isn't required. For more
[information, see docker manifest.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/)

A manifest list can be pulled or referenced in an Amazon ECS task definition or Amazon EKS pod
spec like other Amazon ECR images.

**Prerequisites**

- In your Docker CLI, turn on experimental features. For information about experimental features,

[see Experimental features in the Docker documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#experimental-features)

- The Amazon ECR repository must exist before you push the image. For more information, see the

section called âCreating a repository to store imagesâ.

Pushing a multi-architecture image API Version 2015-09-21 50


-----

- Images must be pushed to your repository before you create the Docker manifest. For

information about how to push an image, see Pushing a Docker image to an Amazon ECR private
repository.

**To push a multi-architecture Docker image to an Amazon ECR repository**

1. Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR registry to which you intend to push your
image. Authentication tokens must be obtained for each registry used, and the tokens are valid
for 12 hours. For more information, see Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR.

To authenticate Docker to an Amazon ECR registry, run the aws ecr get-login-password

value AWS for the username and specify the Amazon ECR registry URI you want to authenticate
to. If authenticating to multiple registries, you must repeat the command for each registry.

_Interface User Guide._
```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS -   password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

```
2. List the images in your repository, confirming the image tags.
```
   aws ecr describe-images --repository-name my-repository

```
3. Create the Docker manifest list. The manifest create command verifies that the referenced
images are already in your repository and creates the manifest locally.
```
   docker manifest create aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my   repository aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my   repository:image_one_tag aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my   repository:image_two

```
4. (Optional) Inspect the Docker manifest list. This enables you to confirm the size and digest for
each image manifest referenced in the manifest list.

#### Pushing a Helm chart to an Amazon ECR private repository

```
You can push Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts to an Amazon ECR repository. To see an
example of this functionality, use the following steps to push a Helm chart to Amazon ECR.

For information about using your Amazon ECR hosted Helm charts with Amazon EKS, see Installing
a Helm chart on an Amazon EKS cluster.

**To push a Helm chart to an Amazon ECR repository**

1. Install the latest version of the Helm client. These steps were written using Helm version
```
  3.8.2. For more information, see Installing Helm.

```
2. [Use the following steps to create a test Helm chart. For more information, see Helm Docs -](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/)
[Getting Started.](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/)

a. Create a Helm chart named helm-test-chart and clear the contents of the templates
directory.
```
      helm create helm-test-chart
      rm -rf ./helm-test-chart/templates/*

```
b. Create a ConfigMap in the templates folder.
```
      cd helm-test-chart/templates
      cat <<EOF > configmap.yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
       name: helm-test-chart-configmap
      data:
       myvalue: "Hello World"
      EOF

```

3. Package the chart. The output will contain the filename of the packaged chart which you use
when pushing the Helm chart.
```
   cd ../..
   helm package helm-test-chart

```
Output
```
   Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /Users/username/helm-test   chart-0.1.0.tgz

```
4. Create a repository to store your Helm chart. The name of your repository should match the
name you used when creating the Helm chart in step 2. For more information, see Creating an
Amazon ECR private repository to store images.
```
   aws ecr create-repository \
      --repository-name helm-test-chart \
      --region us-west-2

```
5. Authenticate your Helm client to the Amazon ECR registry to which you intend to push your
Helm chart. Authentication tokens must be obtained for each registry used, and the tokens are
valid for 12 hours. For more information, see Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR.
```
   aws ecr get-login-password \
      --region us-west-2 | helm registry login \
      --username AWS \
      --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

```
6. Push the Helm chart using the helm push command. The output should include the Amazon
ECR repository URI and SHA digest.
```
   helm push helm-test-chart-0.1.0.tgz
    oci://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/

```
7. Describe your Helm chart.

### Signing an image stored in an Amazon ECR private repository

Amazon ECR integrates with AWS Signer to provide a way for you to sign your container images.
You can store both your container images and the signatures in your private repositories.

#### Considerations

The following should be considered when using Amazon ECR image signing.

- Signatures stored in your repository count against the service quota for the maximum number of

images per repository. For more information, see Amazon ECR service quotas.

- When reference artifacts are present in an repository, Amazon ECR lifecycle policies will

automatically clean up those artifacts within 24 hours of the deletion of the subject image.

Signing an image API Version 2015-09-21 54


-----

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, The following prerequisites must be met.

[â¢ Install and configure the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more information, see Installing or](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

[updating the latest version of the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

- Install the Notation CLI and the AWS Signer plugin for Notation. For more information, see

[Prerequisites for signing container images in the AWS Signer Developer Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/image-signing-prerequisites.html)

- Have a container image stored in an Amazon ECR private repository to sign. For more

information, see Pushing an image to an Amazon ECR private repository.

#### Configure authentication for the Notary client

Before you can create a signature using the Notation CLI, you must configure the client so it can
authenticate to Amazon ECR. If you have Docker installed on the same host where you install
the Notation client, then Notation will reuse the same authentication method you use for the

Docker client. The Docker login and logout commands will allow the Notation sign and verify
commands to use those same credentials, and you donât have to separately authenticate Notation.
[For more information on configuring your Notation client for authentication, see Authenticate with](https://notaryproject.dev/docs/user-guides/how-to/registry-authentication/)
[OCI-compliant registries in the Notary Project documentation.](https://notaryproject.dev/docs/user-guides/how-to/registry-authentication/)

If you are not using Docker or another tool that uses Docker credentials, then we recommend using
the Amazon ECR Docker Credential Helper as your credential store. For more information on how
[to install and configure the Amazon ECR Credential Helper, see Amazon ECR Docker Credential](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper)
[Helper.](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper)

#### Signing an image

The following steps can be used to create the resources necessary to sign a container image and
store the signature in an Amazon ECR private repository. Notation signs images using the digest.

**To sign an image**

1. Create an AWS Signer signing profile using the Notation-OCI-SHA384-ECDSA signing

platform. You can optionally specify a signature validity period using the --signature```
  validity-period parameter. This value may be specified using DAYS, MONTHS, or YEARS. If

```
no validity period is specified, the default value of 135 months is used.

Prerequisites API Version 2015-09-21 55


-----

```
aws signer put-signing-profile --profile-name ecr_signing_profile --platform-id
 Notation-OCI-SHA384-ECDSA

```

2. Authenticate the Notation client to your default registry. The following example uses the AWS
CLI to authenticate the Notation CLI to an Amazon ECR private registry.
```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region region | notation login --username AWS -   password-stdin 111122223333.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

```
3. Use the Notation CLI to sign the image, specifying the image using the repository name and
the SHA digest. This creates the signature and pushes it to the same Amazon ECR private
repository that the image being signed is in.

In the following example, we are signing an image in the curl repository with SHA digest
```
  sha256:ca78e5f730f9a789ef8c63bb55275ac12dfb9e8099e6EXAMPLE.
   notation
    sign 111122223333.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/
   curl@sha256:ca78e5f730f9a789ef8c63bb55275ac12dfb9e8099e6EXAMPLE --plugin
    "com.amazonaws.signer.notation.plugin" --id "arn:aws:signer:region:111122223333:/
   signing-profiles/ecrSigningProfileName"

#### Next steps

```
After you sign your container image, you can verify the signature locally. For instructions about
[verifying an image, see Verify an image locally after signing in the AWS Signer Developer Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/image-verification.html)

### Deleting signatures and other artifacts from an Amazon ECR private repository

You can use the ORAS client to list and delete signatures and other reference type artifacts from an
Amazon ECR private repository. Deleting signatures and other reference artifacts is similar to how

Next steps API Version 2015-09-21 56


-----

an image is deleted (see Deleting an image in Amazon ECR). Here is how to list artifacts and delete
signatures:

**To manage image artifacts using the ORAS CLI**

1. Install and configure the ORAS client.

[For information about installing and configuring the ORAS client, see Installation in the ORAS](https://oras.land/docs/installation)
documentation.

2. To list available artifacts for an Amazon ECR image, use oras discover, followed by an
image name:
```
   oras discover 111222333444.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oci:helloworld

```
The output should look similar to this:
```
   111222333444.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
   oci@sha256:88c0c54329bfdc1d94d6f58cd3fcb1226d46f58670f44a8c689cb3c9b37b6925

     ### sha256:6527bcec87adf1d55460666183b9d0968b3cd4e4bc34602d485206a219851171

```
3. To delete a signature using the ORAS CLI, given the previous example, run the following
command:
```
   oras manifest delete 111222333444.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
   oci@sha256:387c10c1598ee18aae81dcfc86d0d06d116e46461d1c3cda8927e69c48108c42

```
The output should look similar to this:
```
   Are you sure you want to delete the manifest "111222333444.dkr.ecr.us   east-1.amazonaws.com/
   oci@sha256:387c10c1598ee18aae81dcfc86d0d06d116e46461d1c3cda8927e69c48108c42" and
    all tags associated with it? [y/N] y

```
4. Press y. The artifact should be deleted.

5. On the Repositories : repository_name page, choose the image to view the details of.

### Pulling an image to your local environment from an Amazon ECR private repository

If you want to run a Docker image that is available in Amazon ECR, you can pull it to your local
environment with the docker pull command. You can do this from either your default registry or
from a registry associated with another AWS account.

To use an Amazon ECR image in an Amazon ECS task definition, see Using Amazon ECR images
with Amazon ECS.

**Important**

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
```
   ecr:GetAuthorizationToken API through an IAM policy before they can authenticate

```
to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR repository. Amazon
ECR provides several AWS managed policies to control user access at varying levels. For
information about the AWS managed policies for Amazon ECR, see AWS managed policies
for Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

**To pull a Docker image from an Amazon ECR repository**

1. Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR registry that you intend to pull your image
from. Authentication tokens must be obtained for each registry used, and the tokens are valid
for 12 hours. For more information, see Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR.

2. (Optional) Identify the image to pull.

   - You can list the repositories in a registry with the aws ecr describe-repositories
command:
```
      aws ecr describe-repositories

```
Pulling an image API Version 2015-09-21 60


-----

The example registry above has a repository called amazonlinux.

   - You can describe the images within a repository with the aws ecr describe-images
command:
```
      aws ecr describe-images --repository-name amazonlinux

```
The example repository above has an image tagged as latest and 2016.09, with the
image digest
```
    sha256:f1d4ae3f7261a72e98c6ebefe9985cf10a0ea5bd762585a43e0700ed99863807.

```
3. Pull the image using the docker pull command. The image name format should be
```
  registry/repository[:tag] to pull by tag, or registry/repository[@digest] to

```
pull by digest.
```
   docker pull aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazonlinux:latest

```
**Important**

If you receive a repository-url not found: does not exist or no pull
```
     access error, you might need to authenticate your Docker client with Amazon ECR.

```
For more information, see Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR.

### Pulling the Amazon Linux container image

The Amazon Linux container image is built from the same software components that are
included in the Amazon Linux AMI. The Amazon Linux container image is available for use in
any environment as a base image for Docker workloads. If you use the Amazon Linux AMI for
applications in Amazon EC2, you can containerize your applications with the Amazon Linux
container image.

You can use the Amazon Linux container image in your local development environment and then
push your application to AWS using Amazon ECS. For more information, see Using Amazon ECR
images with Amazon ECS.

[The Amazon Linux container image is available on Amazon ECR Public and on Docker Hub. For](https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux/)

### Deleting an image in Amazon ECR

If you're finished using an image, you can delete it from your repository. If you're finished with
a repository, you can delete the entire repository and all of the images within it. For more
information, see Deleting a private repository in Amazon ECR.

As an alternative to deleting images manually, you can create repository lifecycle policies which
provide more control over the lifecycle management of images in your repositories. Lifecycle
policies automate this process for you. For more information, see Automate the cleanup of images
by using lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR.

**Note**

If your repository has a mix of images, some of which were pushed before Amazon ECR
supported OCI v1.1, some signatures will have image indexes or manifest lists pointing
to them. As a result, when you delete a pre-OCI v1.1 image, you might need to manually
delete the manifest list that references the image in order to delete the artifact.

**To delete an image (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the image to delete.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.

4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to delete.

5. On the Repositories: repository_name page, select the box to the left of the image to
delete and choose Delete.

6. In the Delete image(s) dialog box, verify that the selected images should be deleted and
choose Delete.

**To delete an image (AWS CLI)**

1. List the images in your repository. Tagged images will have both an image digest as well as a
list of associated tags. Untagged images will only have an image digest.
```
   aws ecr list-images \
      --repository-name my-repo

```
2. (Optional) Delete any unwanted tags for the image by specifying the tag associated with
the image you want to delete. When the last tag is deleted from an image, the image is also
deleted.
```
   aws ecr batch-delete-image \
      --repository-name my-repo \
      --image-ids imageTag=tag1 imageTag=tag2

```
3. Delete a tagged or untagged image by specifying the image digest. When you delete an image
by referencing its digest, the image and all of its tags are deleted.
```
   aws ecr batch-delete-image \
      --repository-name my-repo \
      --image-ids imageDigest=sha256:4f70ef7a4d29e8c0c302b13e25962d8f7a0bd304EXAMPLE

```
To delete multiple images, you can specify multiple image tags or image digests in the request.
```
   aws ecr batch-delete-image \
      --repository-name my-repo \

### Retagging an image in Amazon ECR

```
With Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 2 images, you can use the --image-tag option of
the put-image command to retag an existing image. You can retag without pulling or pushing
the image with Docker. For larger images, this process saves a considerable amount of network
bandwidth and time required to retag an image.

##### To retag an image (AWS CLI)

**To retag an image with the AWS CLI**

1. Use the batch-get-image command to get the image manifest for the image to retag and

write it to a file. In this example, the manifest for an image with the tag, latest, in the

repository, amazonlinux, is written to an environment variable named MANIFEST.
```
   MANIFEST=$(aws ecr batch-get-image --repository-name amazonlinux --image-ids
    imageTag=latest --output text --query 'images[].imageManifest')

```
2. Use the --image-tag option of the put-image command to put the image manifest to

Amazon ECR with a new tag. In this example, the image is tagged as 2017.03.

**Note**

If the --image-tag option isn't available in your version of the AWS CLI, upgrade
[to the latest version. For more information, see Installing the AWS Command Line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
[Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
```
   aws ecr put-image --repository-name amazonlinux --image-tag 2017.03 --image   manifest "$MANIFEST"

```
3. Verify that your new image tag is attached to your image. In the following output, the image

has the tags latest and 2017.03.
```
   aws ecr describe-images --repository-name amazonlinux

```
The output is as follows:
```
   {
     "imageDetails": [

##### To retag an image (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

**To retag an image with the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell**

1. Use the Get-ECRImageBatch cmdlet to obtain the description of the image to retag and

write it to an environment variable. In this example, an image with the tag, latest, in the

repository, amazonlinux, is written to the environment variable, $Image.

**Note**

```
   $Image = Get-ECRImageBatch -ImageId @{ imageTag="latest" }    RepositoryName amazonlinux

```
2. Write the manifest of the image to the $Manifest environment variable.
```
   $Manifest = $Image.Images[0].ImageManifest

```
3. Use the -ImageTag option of the Write-ECRImage cmdlet to put the image manifest to

Amazon ECR with a new tag. In this example, the image is tagged as 2017.09.
```
   Write-ECRImage -RepositoryName amazonlinux -ImageManifest $Manifest    ImageTag 2017.09

```
4. Verify that your new image tag is attached to your image. In the following output, the image

### Preventing image tags from being overwritten in Amazon ECR

```
You can prevent image tags from being overwritten by turning on tag immutability in a repository.

After tag immutability is turned on, the ImageTagAlreadyExistsException error is returned
if you push an image with a tag that is already in the repository. Tag immutability affects all tags.
You cannot make some tags immutable while others aren't.

You can use the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI tools to set image tag mutability for
a new repository or for an existing repository. To create a repository using console steps, see
Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images.

#### Setting image tag mutability (AWS Management Console)

**To set image tag mutability**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to edit.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.

4. On the Repositories page, choose the Private tab and then select the repository to edit and
choose Edit.

5. For Tag immutability, choose the tag mutability setting for the repository. Repositories
configured with immutable tags prevent image tags from being overwritten. For more
information, see Preventing image tags from being overwritten in Amazon ECR.

6. For Image scan settings, while you can specify the scan settings at the repository level for
basic scanning, it is best practice to specify the scan configuration at the private registry level.
Specify the scanning settings at the private registry allow you to enable either enhanced

scanning or basic scanning as well as define filters to specify which repositories are scanned.
For more information, see Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR.

7. For Encryption settings, this is a view only field as the encryption settings for a repository
can't be changed once the repository is created.

8. Choose Save to update the repository settings.

#### Setting image tag mutability (AWS CLI)

**To create a repository with immutable tags configured**

Use one of the following commands to create a new image repository with immutable tags
configured.

[â¢ create-repository (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.html)
```
  aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE -  region us-east-2

### Container image manifest format support in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR supports the following container image manifest formats:

- Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 1 (used with Docker version 1.9 and older)

- Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 2 (used with Docker version 1.10 and newer)

- Open Container Initiative (OCI) Specifications (v1.0 and v1.1)

Support for Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 2 provides the following functionality:

- The ability to use multiple tags for a singular image.

- Support for storing Windows container images.

#### Amazon ECR image manifest conversion

When you push and pull images to and from Amazon ECR, your container engine client (for
example, Docker) communicates with the registry to agree on a manifest format that is understood
by the client and the registry to use for the image.

When you push an image to Amazon ECR with Docker version 1.9 or earlier, the image manifest
format is stored as Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 1. When you push an image to Amazon ECR
with Docker version 1.10 or later, the image manifest format is stored as Docker Image Manifest V2
Schema 2.

When you pull an image from Amazon ECR by tag, Amazon ECR returns the image manifest format
that is stored in the repository. The format is returned only if that format is understood by the
client. If the stored image manifest format isn't understood by the client, Amazon ECR converts
the image manifest into a format that is understood. For example, if a Docker 1.9 client requests
an image manifest that is stored as Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 2, Amazon ECR returns the
manifest in the Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 1 format. The following table describes the
available conversions supported by Amazon ECR when an image is pulled by tag:

**Schema requested** **Pushed to ECR as V2,** **Pushed to ECR as V2,** **Pushed to ECR as**
**by client** **schema 1** **schema 2** **OCI**

V2, schema 1 No translation Translated to V2, No translation
required schema 1 available

### Using Amazon ECR images with Amazon ECS

You can use your Amazon ECR private repositories to host container images and artifacts that your
Amazon ECS tasks may pull from. For this to work, the Amazon ECS, or Fargate, container agent

must have permissions to make the ecr:BatchGetImage, ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer, and
```
ecr:GetAuthorizationToken APIs.

#### Required IAM permissions

```
The following table shows the IAM role to use, for each launch type, that provides the required
permissions for your tasks to pull from an Amazon ECR private repository. Amazon ECS provides
managed IAM policies that include the required permissions.

**Launch type** **IAM role** **AWS managed IAM policy**

#### Specifying an Amazon ECR image in an Amazon ECS task definition

When creating an Amazon ECS task definition, you can specify a container image hosted
in an Amazon ECR private repository. In the task definition, ensure that you use the

full registry/repository:tag naming for your Amazon ECR images. For example,
```
aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository:latest.

```
The following task definition snippet shows the syntax you would use to specify a container image
hosted in Amazon ECR in your Amazon ECS task definition.

### Using Amazon ECR Images with Amazon EKS

You can use your Amazon ECR images with Amazon EKS.

When referencing an image from Amazon ECR, you must use the full
```
registry/repository:tag naming for the image. For example,
aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository:latest.

#### Required IAM permissions

```
If you have Amazon EKS workloads hosted on managed nodes, self-managed nodes, or AWS
Fargate, review the following:

- Amazon EKS workloads hosted on managed or self-managed nodes: The Amazon EKS worker

node IAM role (NodeInstanceRole) is required. The Amazon EKS worker node IAM role must
contain the following IAM policy permissions for Amazon ECR.

## Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR image scanning helps to identify software vulnerabilities in your container images.
The following scanning types are offered.

**Important**

Switching between the Enhanced scanning, Basic scanning, and the Improved basic
scanning versions will cause previously established scans to no longer be available. You
will have to set up your scans again. However, if you switch back to your previous scanning
version the established scans will be available.

- Enhanced scanningâAmazon ECR integrates with Amazon Inspector to provide automated,

continuous scanning of your repositories. Your container images are scanned for both operating
systems and programming language package vulnerabilities. As new vulnerabilities appear, the
scan results are updated and Amazon Inspector emits an event to EventBridge to notify you.
Enhanced scanning provides the following:

 - OS and programming languages package vulnerabilities

 - Two scanning frequencies: Scan on push and continuous scan

- Basic scanningâAmazon ECR provides two versions of basic scanning which use the Common

Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) database:.

 - AWS native basic scanningâUses AWS native technology, which is now GA and

recommended. All new customer registries are opted into this improved version by default.

 - Clair basic scanningâUses the open-source Clair project and is deprecated.

With basic scanning, you configure your repositories to scan on push or you can perform manual
scans and Amazon ECR provides a list of scan findings. Basic scanning provides the following:

 - OS scans

 - Two scanning frequencies: Manual and scan on push

API Version 2015-09-21 76


-----

**Important**

The new version of basic scanning does not support imageScanFindingsSummary

and imageScanStatus in the DescribeImages API. To view these, use the
```
DescribeImageScanFindings API.

```

### Filters to choose which repositories are scanned in Amazon ECR

When you configure image scanning for your private registry, you can use filters to choose which
repositories are scanned.

When basic scanning is used, you may specify scan on push filters to specify which repositories
are set to do an image scan when new images are pushed. Any repositories not matching a basic
scanning scan on push filter will be set to the manual scan frequency which means to perform a
scan, you must manually trigger the scan.

When enhanced scanning is used, you may specify separate filters for scan on push and continuous
scanning. Any repositories not matching an enhanced scanning filter will have scanning disabled.
If you are using enhanced scanning and specify separate filters for scan on push and continuous
scanning where multiple filters match the same repository, then Amazon ECR enforces the
continuous scanning filter over the scan on push filter for that repository.

#### Filter wildcards

When a filter is specified, a filter with no wildcard will match all repository names that contain the

filter. A filter with a wildcard (*) matches on any repository name where the wildcard replaces zero
or more characters in the repository name.

The following table provides examples where repository names are expressed on the horizontal
axis and example filters are specified on the vertical axis.

**prod** **repo-prod** **prod-repo** **repo-prod-** **prodrepo**
**repo**

prod Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

*prod Yes Yes No No No

### Scan images for OS and programming language package vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR enhanced scanning is an integration with Amazon Inspector which provides
vulnerability scanning for your container images. Your container images are scanned for both
operating systems and programming language package vulnerabilities. You can view the scan
findings with both Amazon ECR and with Amazon Inspector directly. For more information about
[Amazon Inspector, see Scanning container images with Amazon Inspector in the Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/enable-disable-scanning-ecr.html)
_User Guide._

With enhanced scanning, you can choose which repositories are configured for automatic,
continuous scanning and which are configured for scan on push. This is done by setting scan filters.

#### Considerations for enhanced scanning

Consider the following before enabling Amazon ECR enhanced scanning.

- There is no additional cost from Amazon ECR to use this feature, however there is a cost from

[Amazon Inspector to scan your images. For more information, see Amazon Inspector pricing.](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/pricing/)

- Enhanced scanning isn't supported in the following Regions:

 - Middle East (UAE) (me-central-1)

 - Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) (ap-south-2)

 - Israel (Tel Aviv) (il-central-1)

 - Asia Pacific (Melbourne) (ap-southeast-4)

 - Europe (Spain) (eu-south-2)

[â¢ Amazon Inspector supports scanning for specific operating systems. For a full list, see Supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/supported.html#supported-os)

[operating systems - Amazon ECR scanning in the Amazon Inspector User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/supported.html#supported-os)

Enhanced scanning API Version 2015-09-21 78


-----

- Amazon Inspector uses a service-linked IAM role, which provides the permissions needed

to provide enhanced scanning for your repositories. The service-linked IAM role is created
automatically by Amazon Inspector when enhanced scanning is turned on for your private
[registry. For more information, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon Inspector in the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/using-service-linked-roles.html)
_Amazon Inspector User Guide._

- When you initially turn on enhanced scanning for your private registry, Amazon

Inspector only recognizes images pushed to Amazon ECR in the last 30 days, based on
the image push timestamp, or pulled in the last 90 days. Older images will have the
```
 SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED scan status. If you'd like these images to be scanned by Amazon

```
Inspector you should push them again to your repository.

- All images pushed to Amazon ECR after enhanced scanning is turned on are continually scanned

for the configured duration. By default, the duration is Lifetime. This setting can be configured
using the Amazon Inspector console. For more information, see Changing the enhanced scanning
duration for images in Amazon Inspector.

- When enhanced scanning is turned on for your Amazon ECR private registry, repositories

matching the scan filters are scanned using enhanced scanning only. Any repositories that

don't match a filter will have an Off scan frequency and won't be scanned. Manual scans
using enhanced scanning aren't supported. For more information, see Filters to choose which
repositories are scanned in Amazon ECR.

- If you specify separate filters for scan on push and continuous scanning where multiple filters

match the same repository, then Amazon ECR enforces the continuous scanning filter over the
scan on push filter for that repository.

- When enhanced scanning is turned on, Amazon ECR sends an event to EventBridge when the

scan frequency for a repository is changed. Amazon Inspector emits events to EventBridge when
an initial scan is completed and when an image scan finding is created, updated, or closed.

#### IAM permissions required for enhanced scanning in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR enhanced scanning requires an Amazon Inspector service-linked IAM role and that the
IAM principal enabling and using enhanced scanning has permissions to call the Amazon Inspector
APIs needed for scanning. The Amazon Inspector service-linked IAM role is created automatically
by Amazon Inspector when enhanced scanning is turned on for your private registry. For more
[information, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon Inspector in the Amazon Inspector User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/using-service-linked-roles.html)
_Guide._

**repositories box, and then define your filters:**

**Important**

Filters with no wildcard will match all repository names that contain the filter.

Filters with wildcards (*) match on a repository name where the wildcard replaces
zero or more characters in the repository name. To see examples of how filters
behave, see the section called âFilter wildcardsâ.

a. Enter a filter based on repository names, and then choose Add filter.

b. Decide which repositories to scan when an image is pushed:

      - To scan all repositories on push, select Scan on push all repositories.

       - To choose specific repositories to scan on push, enter a filter based on repository

names, and then choose Add filter.

6. Choose Save.

7. Repeat these steps in each Region in which you want to turn on enhanced scanning.

#### Changing the enhanced scanning duration for images in Amazon Inspector

```
You can change the number of days that Amazon Inspector continuously scans the images in
your Amazon ECR private repositories. By default, when enhanced scanning is turned on for your
Amazon ECR private registry, the Amazon Inspector service continually monitors your repositories
until either the image is deleted or enhanced scanning is disabled. The duration that Amazon
Inspector scans your images can be changed using the Amazon Inspector settings. The available

Changing the enhanced scanning duration API Version 2015-09-21 82


-----

scan durations are Lifetime (default), 180 days, and 30 days. When the scan duration for a

repository elapses, the scan status of SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED is displayed when listing
[your scan vulnerabilities. For more information, see Changing the Amazon ECR automated re-scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/enable-disable-scanning-ecr.html#scan-duration-setting)
[duration in the Amazon Inspector User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/enable-disable-scanning-ecr.html#scan-duration-setting)

**To change the enhanced scanning duration setting**

1. [Open the Amazon Inspector console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/inspector/v2/home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/inspector/v2/home)

2. In the left navigation, expand Settings and then choose General.

3. On the Settings page, under ECR re-scan duration choose a setting, then choose Save.

#### EventBridge events sent for enhanced scanning in Amazon ECR

When enhanced scanning is turned on, Amazon ECR sends an event to EventBridge when the scan
frequency for a repository is changed. Amazon Inspector sends events to EventBridge when an
initial scan is completed and when an image scan finding is created, updated, or closed.

**Event for a repository scan frequency change**

When enhanced scanning is turned on for your registry, the following event is sent by Amazon ECR
when there is a change with a resource that has enhanced scanning turned on. This includes new
repositories being created, the scan frequency for a repository being changed, or when images are
created or deleted in repositories with enhanced scanning turned on. For more information, see
Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR.

#### Retrieving the findings for enhanced scans in Amazon ECR

You can retrieve the scan findings for the last completed enhanced image scan, and then open the
findings in Amazon Inspector to see more detail. The software vulnerabilities that were discovered
are listed by severity based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) database.

For troubleshooting details for some common issues when scanning images, see Troubleshooting
image scanning in Amazon ECR.

AWS Management Console

Use the following steps to retrieve image scan findings using the AWS Management Console.

**To retrieve image scan findings**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region where your repository exists.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.

4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to retrieve the
scan findings for.

5. On the Images page, under the Image tag column, select the image tag to retrieve the scan
findings.

6. To view more details in the Amazon Inspector console, choose the vulnerability name in the
**Name column.**

AWS CLI

Use the following AWS CLI command to retrieve image scan findings using the AWS CLI. You can

specify an image using the imageTag or imageDigest, both of which can be obtained using
[the list-images CLI command.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/list-images.html)

[â¢ describe-image-scan-findings (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/describe-image-scan-findings.html)

The following example uses an image tag.
```
    aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
      --repository-name name \
      --image-id imageTag=tag_name \
      --region us-east-2

```
The following example uses an image digest.
```
    aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
      --repository-name name \
      --image-id imageDigest=sha256_hash \
      --region us-east-2

### Scan images for OS vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR

```
Amazon ECR provides two versions of basic scanning that use the Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVEs) database:

- AWS native basic scanningâUses AWS native technology, which is now GA and recommended.

This improved basic scanning is designed to provide customers with better scanning results and
vulnerability detection across a broad set of popular operating systems. This allows customers to
further strengthen the security of their container images. All new customer registries are opted
into this improved version by default.

Basic scanning API Version 2015-09-21 89


-----

- Clair basic scanningâThe previous basic scanning version which uses the open-source Clair

[project and is deprecated. For more information about Clair, see Clair on GitHub.](https://github.com/quay/clair)

[Both AWS native and Clair basic scanning are supported in all regions listed in AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
[by Region, except for those that were added after September, 2024. Because Clair support is](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
deprecated, Clair will not be supported in new regions as they are added and will no longer be
supported in all regions as of October 1, 2025.

Amazon ECR uses the severity for a CVE from the upstream distribution source if available.
Otherwise, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score is used. The CVSS score can be
[used to obtain the NVD vulnerability severity rating. For more information, see NVD Vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
[Severity Ratings.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)

Both versions of Amazon ECR basic scanning support filters to specify which repositories to scan on

push. Any repositories that don't match a scan on push filter are set to the manual scan frequency
which means you must manually start the scan. An image can be scanned once per 24 hours. The
24 hours includes the initial scan on push, if configured, and any manual scans.

The last completed image scan findings can be retrieved for each image. When an image scan
is completed, Amazon ECR sends an event to Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see
Amazon ECR events and EventBridge.

#### Operating system support for basic scanning and improved basic scanning

As a security best practice and for continued coverage, we recommend that you continue to
use supported versions of an operating system. In accordance with vendor policy, discontinued
operating systems are no longer updated with patches and, in many cases, new security advisories
are no longer released for them. In addition, some vendors remove existing security advisories
and detections from their feeds when an affected operating system reaches the end of standard
support. After a distribution loses support from its vendor, Amazon ECR may no longer support
scanning it for vulnerabilities. Any findings that Amazon ECR does generate for a discontinued
operating system should be used for informational purposes only. Listed below are the current
supported operating systems and versions.

#### Configuring basic scanning for images in Amazon ECR

By default, Amazon ECR turns on basic scanning for all private registries. As a result, unless you've
changed the scanning settings on your private registry there is no need to turn on basic scanning.
Basic scanning uses the open-source Clair project.

You can use the following steps to define one or more scan on push filters.

**To turn on basic scanning for your private registry**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories)
[repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to set the scanning configuration for.

AWS Management Console

Use the following steps to retrieve image scan findings using the AWS Management Console.

Retrieving findings API Version 2015-09-21 95


-----

**To retrieve image scan findings**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories)
[repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.

4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to retrieve the
scan findings for.

5. On the Images page, under the Image tag column, select the image tag to retrieve the scan
findings.

AWS CLI

Use the following AWS CLI command to retrieve image scan findings using the AWS CLI. You can

specify an image using the imageTag or imageDigest, both of which can be obtained using
[the list-images CLI command.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/list-images.html)

[â¢ describe-image-scan-findings (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/describe-image-scan-findings.html)

The following example uses an image tag.
```
    aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings --repository-name name --image-id
    imageTag=tag_name --region us-east-2

```
The following example uses an image digest.
```
    aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings --repository-name name --image-id
    imageDigest=sha256_hash --region us-east-2

```
AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell

### Troubleshooting image scanning in Amazon ECR

```
The following are common image scan failures. You can view errors like this in the Amazon
ECR console by displaying the image details or through the API or AWS CLI by using the
```
DescribeImageScanFindings API.

```
UnsupportedImageError

You may get an UnsupportedImageError error when attempting to perform a basic scan

on an image that was built using an operating system that Amazon ECR doesn't support basic
image scanning for. Amazon ECR supports package vulnerability scanning for major versions of
Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Alpine, and RHEL Linux
distributions. Once a distribution loses support from its vendor, Amazon ECR may no longer
support scanning it for vulnerabilities. Amazon ECR does not support scanning images built
[from the Docker scratch image.](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch)

**Important**

When using enhanced scanning, Amazon Inspector supports scanning for specific
[operating systems and media types. For a full list, see Supported operating systems and](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/enable-disable-scanning-ecr.html#ecr-supported-media)
[media types in the Amazon Inspector User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/enable-disable-scanning-ecr.html#ecr-supported-media)

An UNDEFINED severity level is returned

You may receive a scan finding that has a severity level of UNDEFINED. The following are the
common causes for this:

  - The vulnerability was not assigned a priority by the CVE source.

  - The vulnerability was assigned a priority that Amazon ECR did not recognize.

To determine the severity and description of a vulnerability, you can view the CVE directly from
the source.

Troubleshooting image scanning API Version 2015-09-21 97

#### Understanding scan status SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED

When enhanced scanning using Amazon Inspector is enabled for your private registry and you are

viewing your scan vulnerabilities, you may see a scan status of SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED. The
following are the most common causes of this.

- When you initially turn on enhanced scanning for your private registry, Amazon Inspector

only recognizes images pushed to Amazon ECR in the last 30 days, based on the image push

timestamp. Older images will have the SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED scan status. If you'd like
these images to be scanned by Amazon Inspector you should push them again to your repository.

- If the ECR re-scan duration is changed in the Amazon Inspector console and that time elapses,

the scan status of the image is changed to inactive with a reason code of expired, and all
associated findings for the image are scheduled to be closed. This results in the Amazon ECR

console listing the scan status as SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED.

## Sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private registry

Using pull through cache rules, you can sync the contents of an upstream registry with your
Amazon ECR private registry.

Amazon ECR currently supports creating pull through cache rules for the following upstream
registries.

- Docker Hub, Microsoft Azure Container Registry, GitHub Container Registry, and GitLab Container

Registry (Requires authentication)

- Amazon ECR Public, the Kubernetes container image registry, and Quay (Doesn't require

authentication)

For GitLab Container Registry, Amazon ECR supports pull through cache only with GitLab softwareas-a-service offering, GitLab.com.

For the upstream registries that require authentication, you must store your credentials in an
AWS Secrets Manager secret. The Amazon ECR console makes it easy for you to create the Secrets
Manager secret for each of the authenticated upstream registries. For more information about
creating a Secrets Manager secret using the Secrets Manager console, see Storing your upstream
repository credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret.

After you've created a pull through cache rule for the upstream registry, simply pull an image from
that upstream registry using your Amazon ECR private registry URI. Amazon ECR then creates a
repository and caches that image in your private registry. On your subsequent pull requests of
the cached image with a given tag, Amazon ECR checks the upstream registry to see if there is a
new version of the image with that specific tag and attempts to update the image in your private
registry at least once every 24 hours.

### Repository creation templates

Amazon ECR has added support for repository creation templates, which gives you the control to
specify initial configurations for new repositories created by Amazon ECR on your behalf using
pull through cache rules. Each template contains a repository namespace prefix which is used
to match new repositories to a specific template. Templates can specify the configuration for all

Repository creation templates API Version 2015-09-21 99


-----

repository settings including resource-based access policies, tag immutability, encryption, and
lifecycle policies. The settings in a repository creation template are only applied during repository
creation and don't have any effect on existing repositories or repositories created using any other
method. For more information, see Templates to control repositories created during a pull through
cache or replication action.

### Considerations for using pull through cache rules

Consider the following when using Amazon ECR pull through cache rules.

- Creating pull through cache rules isn't supported in the following Regions.

 - China (Beijing) (cn-north-1)

 - China (Ningxia) (cn-northwest-1)

 - AWS GovCloud (US-East) (us-gov-east-1)

 - AWS GovCloud (US-West) (us-gov-west-1)

- AWS Lambda doesn't support pulling container images from Amazon ECR using a pull through

cache rule.

- When pulling images using pull through cache, the Amazon ECR FIPS service endpoints aren't

supported the first time an image is pulled. Using the Amazon ECR FIPS service endpoints work
on subsequent pulls though.

- When a cached image is pulled through the Amazon ECR private registry URI, the image pulls are

initiated by AWS IP addresses. This ensures that the image pull doesn't count against any pull
rate quotas implemented by the upstream registry.

- When a cached image is pulled through the Amazon ECR private registry URI, Amazon ECR

checks the upstream repository at least once every 24 hours to verify whether the cached image
is the latest version. If there is a newer image in the upstream registry, Amazon ECR attempts to
update the cached image. This timer is based off the last pull of the cached image.

- If Amazon ECR is unable to update the image from the upstream registry for any reason and the

image is pulled, the last cached image will still be pulled.

- When creating the Secrets Manager secret that contains the upstream registry credentials, the

secret name must use the ecr-pullthroughcache/ prefix. The secret must also be in the same
account and Region that the pull through cache rule is created in.

- When a multi-architecture image is pulled using a pull through cache rule, the manifest list

and each image referenced in the manifest list are pulled to the Amazon ECR repository. If you

Considerations for using pull through cache rules API Version 2015-09-21 100


-----

only want to pull a specific architecture, you can pull the image using the image digest or tag
associated with the architecture rather than the tag associated with the manifest list.

- Amazon ECR uses a service-linked IAM role, which provides the permissions needed for Amazon

ECR to create the repository, retrieve the Secrets Manager secret value for authentication, and
push the cached image on your behalf. The service-linked IAM role is created automatically when
a pull through cache rule is created. For more information, see Amazon ECR service-linked role
for pull through cache.

- By default, the IAM principal pulling the cached image has the permissions granted to them

through their IAM policy. You may use the Amazon ECR private registry permissions policy
to further scope the permissions of an IAM entity. For more information, see Using registry
permissions.

- Amazon ECR repositories created using the pull through cache workflow are treated like any

other Amazon ECR repository. All repository features, such as replication and image scanning are
supported.

- When Amazon ECR creates a new repository on your behalf using a pull through cache action,

the following default settings are applied to the repository unless there is a matching repository
creation template. You can use a repository creation template to define the settings applied to
repositories created by Amazon ECR on your behalf. For more information, see Templates to
control repositories created during a pull through cache or replication action.

 - Tag immutability â Turned off, tags are mutable and can be overwritten.

 - Encryption â The default AES256 encryption is used.

 - Repository permissions â Omitted, no repository permissions policy is applied.

 - Lifecycle policy â Omitted, no lifecycle policy is applied.

 - Resource tags â Omitted, no resource tags are applied.

- Turning on image tag immutability for repositories using a pull through cache rule will prevent

Amazon ECR from updating images using the same tag.

- When an image is pulled using the pull through cache rule for the first time a route to the

internet may be required. There are certain circumstances in which a route to the internet is
required so it's best to set up a route to avoid any failures. Thus, if you've configured Amazon ECR
to use an interface VPC endpoint using AWS PrivateLink then you need to ensure the first pull
has a route to the internet. One way to do this is to create a public subnet in the same VPC, with
an internet gateway, and then route all outbound traffic to the internet from their private subnet
to the public subnet. Subsequent image pulls using the pull through cache rule don't require

### IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry with an

 Amazon ECR private registry

In addition to the Amazon ECR API permissions needed to authenticate to a private registry and to
push and pull images, the following additional permissions are needed to use pull through cache
rules effectively.

- ecr:CreatePullThroughCacheRule â Grants permission to create a pull through cache rule.

This permission must be granted via an identity-based IAM policy.

- ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage â Grants permission to retrieve the external image and

import it to your private registry. This permission can be granted by using the private registry
permissions policy, an identity-based IAM policy, or by using the resource-based repository
permissions policy. For more information about using repository permissions, see Private
repository policies in Amazon ECR.

- ecr:CreateRepository â Grants permission to create a repository in a private registry.

This permission is required if the repository storing the cached images doesn't already exist.
This permission can be granted by either an identity-based IAM policy or the private registry
permissions policy.

#### Using registry permissions

Amazon ECR private registry permissions may be used to scope the permissions of individual IAM
entities to use pull through cache. If an IAM entity has more permissions granted by an IAM policy
than the registry permissions policy is granting, the IAM policy takes precedence. For example, if

user has ecr:* permissions granted, no additional permissions are needed at the registry level.

**To create a private registry permissions policy (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to configure your private registry permissions
statement in.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Private registry, Registry permissions.

Required IAM permissions API Version 2015-09-21 102


-----

4. On the Registry permissions page, choose Generate statement.

5. For each pull through cache permissions policy statement you want to create, do the
following.

a. For Policy type, choose Pull through cache policy.

b. For Statement id, provide a name for the pull through cache statement policy.

c. For IAM entities, specify the users, groups, or roles to include in the policy.

d. For Repository namespace, select the pull through cache rule to associate the policy with.

e. For Repository names, specify the repository base name to apply the rule for. For
example, if you want to specify the Amazon Linux repository on Amazon ECR Public, the

repository name would be amazonlinux.

**To create a private registry permissions policy (AWS CLI)**

Use the following AWS CLI command to specify the private registry permissions using the AWS CLI.

1. Create a local file named ptc-registry-policy.json with the contents of your registry

policy. The following example grants the ecr-pull-through-cache-user permission to
create a repository and pull an image from Amazon ECR Public, which is the upstream source
associated with the previously created pull through cache rule.
```
   {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
     {
      "Sid": "PullThroughCacheFromReadOnlyRole",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
       "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/ecr-pull-through-cache-user"
      },
      "Action": [
       "ecr:CreateRepository",
       "ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:111122223333:repository/ecr-public/*"
     }
    ]
   }

```
Using registry permissions API Version 2015-09-21 103


-----

**Important**

The ecr-CreateRepository permission is only required if the repository storing
the cached images doesn't already exist. For example, if the repository creation action
and the image pull actions are being done by separate IAM principals such as an
administrator and a developer.


2. [Use the put-registry-policy command to set the registry policy.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/put-registry-policy.html)
```
   aws ecr put-registry-policy \
      --policy-text file://ptc-registry.policy.json

#### Next steps

```
Once you are ready to start using pull through cache rules, the following are the next steps.

- Create a pull through cache rule. For more information, see Creating a pull through cache rule in

Amazon ECR.

- Create a repository creation template. A repository creation template gives you control to define

the settings to use for new repositories created by Amazon ECR on your behalf during a pull
through cache action. For more information, see Templates to control repositories created during
a pull through cache or replication action.

### Creating a pull through cache rule in Amazon ECR

For each upstream registry containing images that you want to cache in your Amazon ECR private
registry, you must create a pull through cache rule.

For upstream registries that require authentication, you must store the credentials in a Secrets
Manager secret. You can use an existing secret or create a new secret. You can create the Secrets
Manager secret in either the Amazon ECR console or the Secrets Manager console. To create a
Secrets Manager secret using the Secrets Manager console instead of the Amazon ECR console, see
Storing your upstream repository credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret.

Next steps API Version 2015-09-21 104

#### Prerequisites

- Verify that you have the proper IAM permissions to create pull through cache rules. For

information, see IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR
private registry.

- For upstream registries that require authentication: If you want to use an existing secret, verify

that the Secrets Manager secret meets the following requirements:

 - The name of the secret begins with ecr-pullthroughcache/. The AWS Management

Console only displays Secrets Manager secrets with the ecr-pullthroughcache/ prefix.

 - The account and Region that the secret is in must match the account and Region that the pull

through cache rule is in.

   --region us-east-2

#### Next steps

```
After you create your pull through cache rules, the following are the next steps:

- Create a repository creation template. A repository creation template gives you control to define

the settings to use for new repositories created by Amazon ECR on your behalf during a pull
through cache action. For more information, see Templates to control repositories created during
a pull through cache or replication action.

- Validate your pull through cache rules. When validating a pull through cache rule, Amazon ECR

makes a network connection with the upstream registry, verifies that it can access the Secrets
Manager secret containing the credentials for the upstream registry, and that authentication was
successful. For more information, see Validating pull through cache rules in Amazon ECR.

- Start using your pull through cache rules. For more information, see Pulling an image with a pull

through cache rule in Amazon ECR.

### Validating pull through cache rules in Amazon ECR

After you create a pull through cache rule, for upstream registries that require authentication
you can validate that the rule works properly. When validating a pull through cache rule, Amazon

Next steps API Version 2015-09-21 113


-----

ECR makes a network connection with the upstream registry, verifies that it can access the
Secrets Manager secret containing the credentials for the upstream registry, and verifies that
authentication was successful.

Before you start working with your pull through cache rules, verify that you have the proper IAM
permissions. For more information, see IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry with
an Amazon ECR private registry.

##### To validate a pull through cache rule (AWS Management Console)

The following steps show how to validate a pull through cache rule using the Amazon ECR console.

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region containing the pull through cache rule to validate.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Private registry, Pull through cache.

4. On the Pull through cache configuration page, select the pull through cache rule to validate.
Then, use the Actions drop down menu and choose View details.

5. On the pull through cache rule detail page, use the Actions drop down menu and choose
**Verify authentication. Amazon ECR will display a banner with the result.**

6. Repeat these steps for each pull through cache rule you want to validate.

##### To validate a pull through cache rule (AWS CLI)

[The validate-pull-through-cache-rule AWS CLI command is used to validate a pull through cache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/validate-pull-through-cache-rule.html)

rule for an Amazon ECR private registry. The following example uses the ecr-public namespace
prefix. Replace that value with the prefix value for the pull through cache rule to validate.
```
 aws ecr validate-pull-through-cache-rule \
   --ecr-repository-prefix ecr-public \
   --region us-east-2

```
In the response, the isValid parameter indicates whether the validation was successful or not. If
```
true, Amazon ECR was able to reach the upstream registry and authentication was successful. If
false, there was an issue and validation failed. The failure parameter indicates the cause.

### Pulling an image with a pull through cache rule in Amazon ECR

The following examples show the command syntax to use when pulling an image using a pull
through cache rule. If you receive an error pulling an upstream image using a pull through cache
rule, see Troubleshooting pull through cache issues in Amazon ECR for the most common errors
and how to resolve them.

Before you start working with your pull through cache rules, verify that you have the proper IAM
permissions. For more information, see IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry with
an Amazon ECR private registry.

**Note**

The following examples use the default Amazon ECR repository namespace values that the
AWS Management Console uses. Ensure that you use the Amazon ECR private repository
URI that you've configured.

##### For Amazon ECR Public
```
 docker pull aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/ecr-public/repository_name/
 image_name:tag

 Kubernetes container registry
 docker pull aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/kubernetes/repository_name/

### Storing your upstream repository credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret

```
When creating a pull through cache rule for an upstream repository that requires authentication,
you must store the credentials in a Secrets Manager secret. There may be a cost for using an
[Secrets Manager secret. For more information, see AWS Secrets Manager pricing.](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/pricing/)

The following procedures walk you through how to create an Secrets Manager secret for each
supported upstream repository. You can optionally use the create pull through cache rule workflow
in the Amazon ECR console to create the secret instead of creating the secret using the Secrets
Manager console. For more information, see Creating a pull through cache rule in Amazon ECR.

### Troubleshooting pull through cache issues in Amazon ECR

When pulling an upstream image using a pull through cache rule, the following are the most
common errors you may receive.

**Repository does not exist**

An error indicating that the repository doesn't exist is most often caused by either the

repository not existing in your Amazon ECR private registry or the ecr:CreateRepository
permission not being granted to the IAM principal pulling the upstream image. To resolve this
error, you should verify that the repository URI in your pull command is correct, the required
IAM permissions are granted to the IAM principal pulling the upstream image, or that the
repository for the upstream image to be pushed to is created in your Amazon ECR private
registry before doing the upstream image pull. For more information about the required IAM
permissions, see IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR

**Requested image not found**

An error indicating that the image can't be found is most often caused by either the image

not existing in the upstream registry or the ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage permission
not being granted to the IAM principal pulling the upstream image but the repository already
being created in your Amazon ECR private registry. To resolve this error, you should verify
the upstream image and image tag name is correct and that it exists and the required IAM
permissions are granted to the IAM principal pulling the upstream image. For more information
about the required IAM permissions, see IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry
with an Amazon ECR private registry.

The following is an example of this error.
```
   Error response from daemon: manifest for 111122223333.dkr.ecr.us   east-1.amazonaws.com/ecr-public/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest not found: manifest
   unknown: Requested image not found

```
**403 Forbidden when pulling from a Docker Hub repository**

When pulling from a Docker Hub repository that is tagged as a Docker Official

**Image, you must include the /library/ in the URI you use. For example,**
```
  aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/docker-hub/
  library/image_name:tag. If you omit the /library/ for Docker Hub Offical images,

```
a 403 Forbidden error will be returned when you attempt to pull the image using a pull
through cache rule. For more information, see Pulling an image with a pull through cache rule
in Amazon ECR.

The following is an example of this error.
```

## Private image replication in Amazon ECR

You can configure your Amazon ECR private registry to support the replication of your repositories.

Amazon ECR supports both cross-Region and cross-account replication. For cross-account
replication to occur, the destination account must configure a registry permissions policy to allow
replication from the source registry to occur. For more information, see Private registry permissions
in Amazon ECR.

**Topics**

- Considerations for private image replication

- Private image replication examples for Amazon ECR

- Configuring private image replication in Amazon ECR

### Considerations for private image replication

The following should be considered when using private image replication.

- Only repository content pushed to a repository after replication is configured is replicated. Any

preexisting content in a repository isn't replicated. Once replication is configured for a repository,
Amazon ECR keeps the destination and source synchronized.

- The repository name will remain the same across Regions and accounts when replication has

occurred. Amazon ECR doesn't support changing the repository name during replication.

- The first time you configure your private registry for replication, Amazon ECR creates a service
linked IAM role on your behalf. The service-linked IAM role grants the Amazon ECR replication
service the permission it needs to create repositories and replicate images in your registry. For
more information, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECR.

- For cross-account replication to occur, the private registry destination must grant permission

to allow the source registry to replicate its images. This is done by setting a private registry
permissions policy. For more information, see Private registry permissions in Amazon ECR.

- If the permission policy for a private registry are changed to remove a permission, any in
progress replications previously granted may complete.

- For cross-Region replication to occur, both the source and destination accounts must be opted
in to the Region prior to any replication actions occurring within or to that Region. For more
[information, see Managing AWS Regions in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html)

Considerations for private image replication API Version 2015-09-21 125


-----

- Cross-Region replication is not supported between AWS partitions. For example, a repository in
```
 us-west-2 can't be replicated to cn-north-1. For more information about AWS partitions, see

```
[ARN format in the AWS General Reference.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arns-syntax)

- The replication configuration for a private registry may contain up to 25 unique destinations

across all rules, with a maximum of 10 rules total. Each rule may contain up to 100 filters. This
allows for specifying separate rules for repositories containing images used for production and
testing, for example.

- The replication configuration supports filtering which repositories in a private registry are

replicated by specifying a repository prefix. For an example, see Example: Configuring crossRegion replication using a repository filter.

- A replication action only occurs once per image push. For example, if you configured cross
Region replication from us-west-2 to us-east-1 and from us-east-1 to us-east-2, an

image pushed to us-west-2 replicates to only us-east-1, it doesn't replicate again to us```
 east-2. This behavior applies to both cross-Region and cross-account replication.

```
- The majority of images replicate in less than 30 minutes, but in rare cases the replication might

take longer.

- Registry replication doesn't perform any delete actions. Replicated images and repositories can

be manually deleted when they are no longer being used.

- Repository policies, including IAM policies, and lifecycle policies aren't replicated and don't have

any effect other than on the repository they are defined for.

- Repository settings aren't replicated. The tag immutability, image scanning, and KMS encryption

settings are disabled by default on all repositories created because of a replication action. The
tag immutability and image scanning setting can be changed after the repository is created.

However, the setting only applies to images pushed after the setting has changed.

- If tag immutability is enabled on a repository and an image is replicated that uses the same tag

as an existing image, the image is replicated but won't contain the duplicated tag. This might
result in the image being untagged.

### Private image replication examples for Amazon ECR

The following examples show common use cases for private image replication. If you configure
replication by using the AWS CLI, you can use the JSON examples as a starting point when you
create your JSON file. If you configure replication by using the AWS Management Console, you will
see similar JSON when you review your replication rule on the Review and submit page.

### Configuring private image replication in Amazon ECR

Configure replication per Region for your private registry. You can configure cross-Region
replication or cross-account replication.

For examples of how replication is commonly used, see Private image replication examples for
Amazon ECR.

##### To configure registry replication settings (AWS Management Console)

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to configure your registry replication settings for.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Private registry.

4. On the Private registry page, choose Settings and then choose Edit under Replication
**configuration.**

5. On the Replication page, choose Add replication rule.

6. On the Destination types page, choose whether to enable cross-Region replication, crossaccount replication, or both and then choose Next.

7. If cross-Region replication is enabled, then for Configure destination regions, choose one or
more Destination regions and then choose Next.

8. If cross-account replication is enabled, then for Cross-account replication, choose the crossaccount replication setting for the registry. For Destination account, enter the account ID
for the destination account and one or more Destination regions to replicate to. Choose
**Destination account + to configure additional accounts as replication destinations.**

**Important**

For cross-account replication to occur, the destination account must configure a
registry permissions policy to allow replication to occur. For more information, see
Private registry permissions in Amazon ECR.

9. (Optional) On the Add filters page, specify one or more filters for the replication rule and then
choose Add. Repeat this step for each filter you want to associate with the replication action.
A filter must be specified as a repository name prefix. If no filters are added, the contents of all
repositories are replicated. Choose Next once all filters have been added.

-----

10. On the Review and submit page, review the replication rule configuration and then choose

**Submit rule.**

##### To configure registry replication settings (AWS CLI)

1. Create a JSON file containing the replication rules to define for your registry. A replication
configuration may contain up to 10 rules, with up to 25 unique destinations across all rules
and 100 filters per each rule. To configure cross-Region replication within your own account,
you specify your own account ID. For more examples, see Private image replication examples
for Amazon ECR.
```
   {
    "rules": [{
    "destinations": [{
     "region": "destination_region",
     "registryId": "destination_accountId"
    }],
    "repositoryFilters": [{
     "filter": "repository_prefix_name",
     "filterType": "PREFIX_MATCH"
    }]
    }]
   }

```
2. Create a replication configuration for your registry.
```
   aws ecr put-replication-configuration \
      --replication-configuration file://replication-settings.json \
      --region us-west-2

```
3. Confirm your registry settings.
```
   aws ecr describe-registry \
      --region us-west-2

```

## Templates to control repositories created during a pull through cache or replication action

Use Amazon ECR repository creation templates to define the settings for repositories created by
Amazon ECR on your behalf. The settings in a repository creation template are only applied during
repository creation and don't have any effect on existing repositories or repositories created using
any other method. Currently, repository creation templates can be used to apply settings during
repository creation for these features:

- Pull through cache

- Replication

Repository creation templates aren't supported in the following Regions:

- China (Beijing) (cn-north-1)

- China (Ningxia) (cn-northwest-1)

- AWS GovCloud (US-East) (us-gov-east-1)

- AWS GovCloud (US-West) (us-gov-west-1)

### How repository creation templates work

There are times when Amazon ECR needs to create a new private repository on your behalf. For
example:

- The first time you use a pull through cache rule to retrieve the contents of an upstream

repository and store it in your Amazon ECR private registry.

- When you want Amazon ECR to replicate a repository to another region or account.

When there isn't a repository creation template that matches your pull through cache rule or
replicated repository, Amazon ECR uses the default settings for the new repository. These default

settings include turning off tag immutability, using AES-256 encryption, and not applying any
repository or lifecycle policies.

Using a repository creation template gives you the ability to define the settings Amazon ECR
applies to new repositories created through the pull through cache and replication actions. You can

How it works API Version 2015-09-21 132


-----

define the tag immutability, encryption configuration, repository permissions, lifecycle policy, and
resource tags for the new repositories.

The following diagram shows the workflow that Amazon ECR uses when a repository creation
template is used with a pull through cache action.

The following describes each parameter in a repository creation template in detail.

Prefix

The Prefix is the repository namespace prefix to associate with the template. All repositories
created using this prefix will have the settings applied that are defined in this template. For

example, a prefix of prod would apply to all repositories beginning with prod/. Similarly, a

prefix of prod/team would apply to all repositories beginning with prod/team/. In a registry
containing two templates, if one template has the prefix "prod" and the other has the prefix
"prod/team", the template with the prefix "prod/team" will be applied to all repositories whose
names start with "prod/team/".

To apply a template to all repositories in your registry that don't have an associated creation

template, you can use ROOT as the prefix.

**Important**

There is always an assumed / applied to the end of the prefix. If you specify ecr```
    public as the prefix, Amazon ECR treats that as ecr-public/. When using a pull

```
through cache rule, the repository prefix you specify during rule creation is what you
should specify as your repository creation template prefix as well.

How it works API Version 2015-09-21 133


-----

Description

This template description is optional and is used to describe the purpose for the repository
creation template.

Applied For

The applied for setting determines which ECR-created repositories will be created with this

template. The valid values are PULL_THROUGH_CACHE and REPLICATION. For example, the
first time you use a pull through cache rule to retrieve the contents of an upstream repository
and store it in your Amazon ECR private registry. When there isn't a repository creation
template that matches your pull through cache rule, Amazon ECR uses the default settings for
the new repository.

Repository creation role

The repository creation role is an IAM role ARN that will be assumed by Amazon ECR when
creating and configuring repositories via repository creation templates. This role must be
provided when using repository tags and/or KMS in the template, otherwise the repository
creation will fail.

Image tag mutability

The tag mutability setting to use for repositories created using the template. If this parameter
is omitted, the default setting of MUTABLE will be used which will allow image tags to be
overwritten. This is the recommended setting to use for templates used for repositories created
by pull through cache actions. This ensures that Amazon ECR can update the cached images
when the tags are the same.

If IMMUTABLE is specified, all image tags within the repository will be immutable which will
prevent them from being overwritten.

Encryption configuration

**Important**

Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS (DSSE-KMS) is only available in the
AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

The encryption configuration to use for repositories created using the template.

How it works API Version 2015-09-21 134


-----

If you use the KMS encryption type, the contents of the repository will be encrypted using
server-side encryption with an AWS Key Management Service key stored in AWS KMS. When
you use AWS KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the default AWS managed AWS
KMS key for Amazon ECR, or specify your own AWS KMS key, which you already created. You
can further choose to use Single-layer or Dual-layer encryption with AWS KMS. For more
information, see Encryption at rest . If you're using the KMS encryption type and using it with
cross region replication, you may need additional permissions. For more information, see
[Creating a KMS key policy for replication.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry-permissions-create.html)

If you use the AES256 encryption type, Amazon ECR uses server-side encryption with Amazon
S3-managed encryption keys which encrypts the images in the repository using an AES-256
[encryption algorithm. For more information, see Protecting data using server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)
[with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)
_Guide._

Repository permissions

The repository policy to apply to repositories created using the template. A repository policy
uses resource-based permissions to control access to a repository. Resource-based permissions
let you specify which IAM users or roles have access to a repository and what actions they can
perform on it. By default, only the AWS account that created the repository has access to a
repository. You can apply a policy document to grant or deny additional permissions to your
repository. For more information, see Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

Repository lifecycle policy

The lifecycle policy to use for repositories created using the template. A lifecycle policy
provides more control over the lifecycle management of images in a private repository. A
lifecycle policy contains one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon ECR.
This provides a way to automate the cleaning up of your container images by expiring images
based on age or count. For more information, see Automate the cleanup of images by using
lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR.

Resource tags

The resource tags are metadata to apply to the repository to help you categorize and organize
them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. This
permission needs to be applied on the destination registry policy if you are using repository
creation templates with cross region replication.

How it works API Version 2015-09-21 135


-----

### Creating a repository creation template in Amazon ECR

You can create a repository creation template to define the settings to use for repositories
created by Amazon ECR on your behalf during pull through cache or replication actions. Once the

repository creation template is created, all new repositories created will have the settings applied.
This doesn't have any effect on any previously created repositories.

When setting up a repository with templates, you have the option to specify KMS keys and
resource tags. If you intend to use KMS keys, resource tags, or a combination of both in one or
more templates, you need to:

- Create a custom policy for repository creation templates.

- Create an IAM role for repository creation templates.

Once configured, you can attach the custom role to specific templates in your registry.

#### IAM permissions for creating repository creation templates

The following permissions are needed for an IAM principal to manage repository creation
templates. These permission must be granted using an identity-based IAM policy.

- ecr:CreateRepositoryCreationTemplate â Grants permission to create a repository

creation template.

- ecr:UpdateRepositoryCreationTemplate â Grants permission to update a repository

creation template.

- ecr:DescribeRepositoryCreationTemplates â Grants permission to list repository

creation templates in a registry.

- ecr:DeleteRepositoryCreationTemplate â Grants permission to delete a repository

creation template.

- ecr:CreateRepository â Grants permission to create an Amazon ECR repository.

- ecr:PutLifecyclePolicy â Grants permission to create a lifecycle policy and apply it to a

repository. This permission is only required if the repository creation template includes a lifecycle
policy.

- ecr:SetRepositoryPolicy â Grants permission to create a permissions policy for a

repository. This permission is only required if the repository creation template includes a
repository policy.

-----

- iam:PassRole â Grants permission to allow an entity to pass a role to a service or application.

This permission is necessary for services and applications that need to assume a role to perform
actions on your behalf.

#### Create a custom policy for repository creation templates

You can use the AWS Management Console to define a policy that will be subsequently associated
with an IAM role. This IAM role can then be utilized as a repository creation role when configuring a
repository creation template.

5. Choose Next.

6. From the Add permissions page, select the check box next to the custom policy you
created earlier from the list of Permissions policies and choose Next.

7. For Role name, enter a name for your role. Role names must be unique within your AWS
account. When a role name is used in a policy or as part of an ARN, the role name is case
sensitive. When a role name appears to customers in the console, such as during the sign-in
process, the role name is case insensitive. Because various entities might reference the role,
you can't edit the name of the role after it is created.

8. (Optional) For Description, enter a description for the new role.

9. Review the role and then choose Create role.

#### Create a repository creation template

Once you've completed the necessary prerequisites for your templates, you can proceed to create
the repository creation templates.

AWS Management Console

**To create a repository creation template (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create the repository creation template in.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Private registry, Repository creation templates.

4. On the Repository creation templates page, choose Create template.

5. On the Step 1: Define template page, for Template details, choose A specific prefix to
apply the template to a specific repository namespace prefix or choose Any prefix in your
**ECR registry to apply the template to all repositories that don't match any other template**
in the Region.

a. If you choose A specific prefix, for Prefix specify the repository namespace prefix to

apply the template to. There is always an assumed / applied to the end of the prefix.

Create a repository creation template API Version 2015-09-21 139


-----

For example, a prefix of prod would apply to all repositories beginning with prod/.

Similarly, a prefix of prod/team would apply to all repositories beginning with prod/
```
      team/.

```
b. If you choose Any prefix in your ECR registry, the Prefix will be set to ROOT.

6. For Applied for, specify which Amazon ECR workflows this template will apply to. The

options are PULL_THROUGH_CACHE and REPLICATION.

7. For Template description, specify an optional description for the template and then
choose Next.

8. On the Step 2: Add repository creation configuration page, specify the repository setting
configuration to apply to repositories created using the template.

a. For Image tag mutability, choose the tag mutability setting to use. For more
information, see Preventing image tags from being overwritten in Amazon ECR.

When Mutable is selected, image tags can be overwritten. This is the recommended
setting to use for templates used for repositories created by replication actions. This
ensures that Amazon ECR can update the cached images when the tags are the same.

When Immutable is selected, image tags are prevented from being
overwritten. After the repository is configured for immutable tags, an
```
      ImageTagAlreadyExistsException error is returned if there is an attempt to push

```
an image with a tag that is already in the repository. When tag immutability is turned
on for a repository, this affects all tags and you cannot make some tags immutable
while others aren't.

b. For Encryption configuration, choose the encryption setting to use. For more
information, see Encryption at rest.

When AES-256 is selected, Amazon ECR uses server-side encryption with Amazon
Simple Storage Service-managed encryption keys which encrypts your data at rest
using an industry standard AES-256 encryption algorithm. This is offered at no
additional cost.

When AWS KMS is selected, Amazon ECR uses server-side encryption with keys stored
in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). When you use AWS KMS to encrypt your
data, you can either use the default AWS managed key, which is managed by Amazon
ECR, or specify your own AWS KMS key, which is referred to as a customer managed
_key._

Create a repository creation template API Version 2015-09-21 140


-----

**Note**

The encryption settings for a repository can't be changed once the repository is
created.


c. For Repository permissions, specify the repository permissions policy to apply to
repositories created using this template. You can optionally use the drop down to
select one of the JSON samples for the most common use cases. For more information,
see Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

d. For Repository lifecycle policy, specify the repository lifecycle policy to apply to
repositories created using this template. You can optionally use the drop down to
select one of the JSON samples for the most common use cases. For more information,
see Automate the cleanup of images by using lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR.

e. For Repository AWS tags, specify the metadata, in the form of key-value pairs, to
associate with the repositories created using this template and then choose Next. For
more information, see Tagging a private repository in Amazon ECR.

f. For Repository creation role, select a custom IAM role from the drop-down menu to
be used for repository creation templates when using repository tags or KMS in the
template (see Create an IAM role for repository creation templates for details).Then
choose Next.

9. On the Step 3: Review and create page, review the settings you specified for the repository
creation template. Choose the Edit option to make changes. Choose Create once you're
done.

```
2. Create a file named repository-creation-template.json with the output of the
previous step. This template sets a KMS encryption key for any repository created under
```
    prod/* with a repository policy that ALLOWs pushing and pulling images to future

```
repositories, sets a lifecycle policy that will expire images older than two weeks and sets a

custom role that will let ECR access the KMS key and assign the resource tag examplekey
to future repositories.
```
     {
       "prefix": "prod",

## Automate the cleanup of images by using lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR lifecycle policies provide more control over the lifecycle management of images in
a private repository. A lifecycle policy contains one or more rules, and each rule defines an action
for Amazon ECR. Based on the expiration criteria in the lifecycle policy, images expire based on age
or count within 24 hours. When Amazon ECR performs an action based on a lifecycle policy, this
action is captured as an event in AWS CloudTrail. For more information, see Logging Amazon ECR
actions with AWS CloudTrail.

### How lifecycle policies work

A lifecycle policy consists of one or more rules that determine which images in a repository should
be expired. When considering the use of lifecycle policies, it's important to use the lifecycle policy
preview to confirm which images the lifecycle policy expires before applying it to a repository.
Once a lifecycle policy is applied to a repository, you should expect that images become expired
within 24 hours after they meet the expiration criteria. When Amazon ECR performs an action
based on a lifecycle policy, this is captured as an event in AWS CloudTrail. For more information,
see Logging Amazon ECR actions with AWS CloudTrail.

The following diagram shows the lifecycle policy workflow.

1. Create one or more test rules.

2. Save the test rules and run the preview.

3. The lifecycle policy evaluator goes through all of the rules and marks the images that each rule
affects.

4. The lifecycle policy evaluator then applies the rules, based on rule priority, and displays which
images in the repository are set to be expired.

5. Review the results of the test, ensuring that the images that are marked to be expired are what
you intended.

How lifecycle policies work API Version 2015-09-21 146


-----

6. Apply the test rules as the lifecycle policy for the repository.

7. Once the lifecycle policy is created, you should expect that images become expired within 24
hours after they meet the expiration criteria.

#### Lifecycle policy evaluation rules

The lifecycle policy evaluator is responsible for parsing the plaintext JSON of the lifecycle policy,
evaluating all rules, and then applying those rules based on rule priority to the images in the
repository. The following explains the logic of the lifecycle policy evaluator in more detail. For
examples, see Examples of lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR.

- All rules are evaluated at the same time, regardless of rule priority. After all rules are evaluated,

they are then applied based on rule priority.

- An image is expired by exactly one or zero rules.

- An image that matches the tagging requirements of a rule cannot be expired by a rule with a

lower priority.

- Rules can never mark images that are marked by higher priority rules, but can still identify them

as if they haven't been expired.

- The set of rules must contain a unique set of tag prefixes.

- Only one rule is allowed to select untagged images.

- If an image is referenced by a manifest list, it cannot be expired without the manifest list being

deleted first.

- Expiration is always ordered by pushed_at_time, and always expires older images before newer

ones.

- A lifecycle policy rule may specify either tagPatternList or tagPrefixList, but not both.

However, a lifecycle policy may contain multiple rules where different rules use both pattern

and prefix lists. An image is successfully matched if all of the tags in the tagPatternList or
```
 tagPrefixList value are matched against any of the image's tags.

```
- The tagPatternList or tagPrefixList parameters may only used if the tagStatus is
```
 tagged.

```
- When using tagPatternList, an image is successfully matched if it matches the wildcard filter.

For example, if a filter of prod* is applied, it would match image-tags whose name begins with
```
 prod such as prod, prod1, or production-team1. Similarly, if a filter of *prod* is applied, it

```
would match image-tags whose name contains prod such as repo-production or prod-team.

Lifecycle policy evaluation rules API Version 2015-09-21 147


-----

**Important**

There is a maximum limit of four wildcards (*) per string. For example,
```
["*test*1*2*3", "test*1*2*3*"] is valid but ["test*1*2*3*4*5*6"] is invalid.

```


- When using tagPrefixList, an image is successfully matched if all of the wildcard filters in

the tagPrefixList value are matched against any of the image's tags.

- The countUnit parameter is only used if countType is sinceImagePushed.

- With countType = imageCountMoreThan, images are sorted from youngest to oldest based

on pushed_at_time and then all images greater than the specified count are expired.

- With countType = sinceImagePushed, all images whose pushed_at_time is older than the

specified number of days based on countNumber are expired.

### Creating a lifecycle policy preview in Amazon ECR

You can use a lifecycle policy preview to see the impact of a lifecycle policy on an image repository
before you apply it. It is considered best practice to do a preview before applying a lifecycle policy
to a repository.

**Note**

If you are using Amazon ECR replication to make copies of a repository across different
Regions or accounts, note that a lifecycle policy can only take an action on repositories in
the Region it was created in. Therefore, if you have replication turned on you may want to
create a lifecycle policy in each Region and account you are replicating your repositories to.

**To create a lifecycle policy preview (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository on which to perform a
lifecycle policy preview.

3. In the navigation pane, under Private registry, choose Repositories.

4. On the Private repositories page, select a repository and that use the Actions drop down to
choose Lifecycle policies.

5. On the lifecycle policy rules page for the repository, choose Edit test rules, Create rule.

6. Specify the following details for each test lifecycle policy rule.

a. For Rule priority, type a number for the rule priority. The rule priority determines in what
order the lifecycle policy rules are applied.

b. For Rule description, type a description for the lifecycle policy rule.

c. For Image status, choose Tagged (wildcard matching), Tagged (prefix matching),
**Untagged, or Any.**

**Important**

If you specify multiple tags, only the images with all specified tags are selected.

d. If you chose Tagged (wildcard matching) for Image status, then for Specify tags for
**wildcard matching, you can specify a list of image tags with a wildcard (*) on which to**

take action with your lifecycle policy. For example, if your images are tagged as prod,
```
    prod1, prod2, and so on, you would specify prod* to take action on all of them. If you

```
specify multiple tags, only the images with all specified tags are selected.

**Important**

There is a maximum limit of four wildcards (*) per string. For example,
```
       ["*test*1*2*3", "test*1*2*3*"] is valid but ["test*1*2*3*4*5*6"] is

```
invalid.

e. If you chose Tagged (prefix matching) for Image status, then for Specify tags for prefix
**matching, you can specify a list of image tags on which to take action with your lifecycle**
policy.

f. For Match criteria, choose either Since image pushed or Image count more than and
then specify a value.

g. Choose Save.

7. Create additional test lifecycle policy rules by repeating steps 5â7.

8. To run the lifecycle policy preview, choose Save and run test.

9. Under Image matches for test lifecycle rules, review the impact of your lifecycle policy
preview.

10. If you are satisfied with the preview results, choose Apply as lifecycle policy to create a

lifecycle policy with the specified rules. You should expect that after applying a lifecycle policy,
the affected images are expired within 24 hours.

11. If you aren't satisfied with the preview results, you may delete one or more test lifecycle rules

and create one or more rules to replace them and then repeat the test.

### Creating a lifecycle policy for a repository in Amazon ECR

Use a lifecycle policy to create a set of rules that expire unused repository images. After creating a
lifecycle policy, the affected images are expired within 24 hours.

**Note**

If you are using Amazon ECR replication to make copies of a repository across different
Regions or accounts, note that a lifecycle policy can only take an action on repositories in
the Region it was created in. Therefore, if you have replication turned on you may want to
create a lifecycle policy in each Region and account you are replicating your repositories to.

#### Prerequisite

**Best practice: Create a lifecycle policy preview to verify that the images expired by your lifecycle**
policy rules are what you intend. For instructions, see Creating a lifecycle policy preview in Amazon
ECR.

#### Filtering on multiple rules

The following examples use multiple rules in a lifecycle policy. An example repository and lifecycle
policy are given along with an explanation of the outcome.

##### Example A

Repository contents:

- Image A, Taglist: ["beta-1", "prod-1"], Pushed: 10 days ago

- Image B, Taglist: ["beta-2", "prod-2"], Pushed: 9 days ago

- Image C, Taglist: ["beta-3"], Pushed: 8 days ago

Lifecycle policy text:
```
 {
   "rules": [
     {
       "rulePriority": 1,
       "description": "Rule 1",
       "selection": {
         "tagStatus": "tagged",
         "tagPatternList": ["prod*"],
         "countType": "imageCountMoreThan",
         "countNumber": 1
       },
       "action": {
         "type": "expire"
       }
     },
     {
       "rulePriority": 2,
       "description": "Rule 2",
       "selection": {

```
Filtering on multiple rules API Version 2015-09-21 154

```
        "tagStatus": "tagged",
        "tagPatternList": ["beta*"],
        "countType": "imageCountMoreThan",
        "countNumber": 1
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "expire"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

The logic of this lifecycle policy would be:

- Rule 1 identifies images tagged with prefix prod. It should mark images, starting with the oldest,

until there is one or fewer images remaining that match. It marks Image A for expiration.

- Rule 2 identifies images tagged with prefix beta. It should mark images, starting with the oldest,

until there is one or fewer images remaining that match. It marks both Image A and Image B
for expiration. However, Image A has already been seen by Rule 1 and if Image B were expired it
would violate Rule 1 and thus is skipped.

- Result: Image A is expired.

##### Example B

This is the same repository as the previous example but the rule priority order is changed to
illustrate the outcome.

Repository contents:

- Image A, Taglist: ["beta-1", "prod-1"], Pushed: 10 days ago

- Image B, Taglist: ["beta-2", "prod-2"], Pushed: 9 days ago

- Image C, Taglist: ["beta-3"], Pushed: 8 days ago

Lifecycle policy text:

   "rules": [
     {
       "rulePriority": 1,

      },
      "action": {
        "type": "expire"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

The logic of this lifecycle policy would be:

- Rule 1 identifies images tagged with prefix beta. It should mark images, starting with the oldest,

until there is one or fewer images remaining that match. It sees all three images and would mark
Image A and Image B for expiration.

- Rule 2 identifies images tagged with prefix prod. It should mark images, starting with the oldest,

until there is one or fewer images remaining that match. It would see no images because all
available images were already seen by Rule 1 and thus would mark no additional images.

- Result: Images A and B are expired.

#### Filtering on multiple tags in a single rule

The following examples specify the lifecycle policy syntax for multiple tag patterns in a single rule.
An example repository and lifecycle policy are given along with an explanation of the outcome.

Filtering on multiple tags in a single rule API Version 2015-09-21 156


-----

##### Example A

When multiple tag patterns are specified on a single rule, images must match all listed tag
patterns.

Repository contents:

- Image A, Taglist: ["alpha-1"], Pushed: 12 days ago

- Image B, Taglist: ["beta-1"], Pushed: 11 days ago

- Image C, Taglist: ["alpha-2", "beta-2"], Pushed: 10 days ago

- Image D, Taglist: ["alpha-3"], Pushed: 4 days ago

- Image E, Taglist: ["beta-3"], Pushed: 3 days ago

- Image F, Taglist: ["alpha-4", "beta-4"], Pushed: 2 days ago
```
 {
   "rules": [
     {

       "action": {
         "type": "expire"
       }
     }
   ]
 }

```
The logic of this lifecycle policy would be:

- Rule 1 identifies images tagged with prefix alpha and beta. It sees images C and F. It should

mark images that are older than five days, which would be Image C.

- Result: Image C is expired.

       "action": {
         "type": "expire"
       }
     }
   ]
 }

```
The logic of this lifecycle policy would be:

- Rule 1 identifies images tagged with prefix alpha and beta. It sees all images. It should mark

images, starting with the oldest, until there is one or fewer images remaining that match. It
marks image A and B for expiration.

- Result: Images A and B are expired.

#### Filtering on all images

The following lifecycle policy examples specify all images with different filters. An example
repository and lifecycle policy are given along with an explanation of the outcome.

Filtering on all images API Version 2015-09-21 158

##### Example A

The following shows the lifecycle policy syntax for a policy that applies to all rules but keeps only
one image and expires all others.

Repository contents:

- Image A, Taglist: ["alpha-1"], Pushed: 4 days ago

- Image B, Taglist: ["beta-1"], Pushed: 3 days ago

- Image C, Taglist: [], Pushed: 2 days ago

- Image D, Taglist: ["alpha-2"], Pushed: 1 day ago

       },
       "action": {
         "type": "expire"
       }
     }
   ]
 }

```
The logic of this lifecycle policy would be:

- Rule 1 identifies all images. It sees images A, B, C, and D. It should expire all images other than

the newest one. It marks images A, B, and C for expiration.

- Result: Images A, B, and C are expired.

##### Example B

The following example illustrates a lifecycle policy that combines all the rule types in a single
policy.

```

The logic of this lifecycle policy would be:

- Rule 1 identifies images tagged with prefix alpha. It identifies images A and C. It should keep

the newest image and mark the rest for expiration. It marks image A for expiration.

- Rule 2 identifies untagged images. It identifies images B and E. It should mark all images older

than one day for expiration. It marks image B for expiration.

- Rule 3 identifies all images. It identifies images A, B, C, D, and E. It should keep the newest image

and mark the rest for expiration. However, it can't mark images A, B, C, or E because they were
identified by higher priority rules. It marks image D for expiration.

- Result: Images A, B, and D are expired.

### Lifecycle policy properties in Amazon ECR

Lifecycle policies have the following properties.

To see examples of lifecycle policies, see Examples of lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR. For

instructions about creating a lifecycle policy by using the AWS CLI, see To create a lifecycle policy
(AWS CLI).

#### Rule priority
```
rulePriority

```
Type: integer

Required: yes

Sets the order in which rules are applied, lowest to highest. A lifecycle policy rule with a priority

of 1 is applied first, a rule with priority of 2 is next, and so on. When you add rules to a lifecycle

Lifecycle policy properties API Version 2015-09-21 161


-----

policy, you must give them each a unique value for rulePriority. Values don't need to be

sequential across rules in a policy. A rule with a tagStatus value of any must have the highest

value for rulePriority and be evaluated last.

#### Description
```
description

```
Type: string

Required: no

(Optional) Describes the purpose of a rule within a lifecycle policy.

#### Tag status
```
tagStatus

```
Type: string

Required: yes

Determines whether the lifecycle policy rule that you are adding specifies a tag for an image.

Acceptable options are tagged, untagged, or any. If you specify any, then all images

have the rule evaluated against them. If you specify tagged, then you must also specify a
```
  tagPrefixList value. If you specify untagged, then you must omit tagPrefixList.

#### Tag pattern list
tagPatternList

```
Type: list[string]

Required: yes, if tagStatus is set to tagged and tagPrefixList isn't specified

When creating a lifecycle policy for tagged images, it's best practice to use a tagPatternList
to specify the tags to expire. You specify a comma-separated list of image tag patterns that

may contain wildcards (*) on which to take action with your lifecycle policy. For example, if your

Description API Version 2015-09-21 162


-----

images are tagged as prod, prod1, prod2, and so on, you would use the tag pattern list prod*
to specify all of them. If you specify multiple tags, only the images with all specified tags are
selected.

**Important**

There is a maximum limit of four wildcards (*) per string. For example,
```
    ["*test*1*2*3", "test*1*2*3*"] is valid but ["test*1*2*3*4*5*6"] is invalid.

#### Tag prefix list
tagPrefixList

```
Type: list[string]

Required: yes, if tagStatus is set to tagged and tagPatternList isn't specified

Only used if you specified "tagStatus": "tagged" and you aren't specifying a
```
  tagPatternList. You must specify a comma-separated list of image tag prefixes on which to

```
take action with your lifecycle policy. For example, if your images are tagged as prod, prod1,
```
  prod2, and so on, you would use the tag prefix prod to specify all of them. If you specify

```
multiple tags, only the images with all specified tags are selected.

#### Count type
```
countType

```
Type: string

Required: yes

Specify a count type to apply to the images.

If countType is set to imageCountMoreThan, you also specify countNumber to create a rule

that sets a limit on the number of images that exist in your repository. If countType is set to
```
  sinceImagePushed, you also specify countUnit and countNumber to specify a time limit on

```
the images that exist in your repository.

Tag prefix list API Version 2015-09-21 163


-----

#### Count unit
```
countUnit

```
Type: string

Required: yes, only if countType is set to sinceImagePushed

Specify a count unit of days to indicate that as the unit of time, in addition to countNumber,
which is the number of days.

This should only be specified when countType is sinceImagePushed; an error will occur if

you specify a count unit when countType is any other value.

#### Count number
```
countNumber

```
Type: integer

Required: yes

Specify a count number. Acceptable values are positive integers (0 is not an accepted value).

If the countType used is imageCountMoreThan, then the value is the maximum

number of images that you want to retain in your repository. If the countType used is
```
  sinceImagePushed, then the value is the maximum age limit for your images.

#### Action
type

```
Type: string

Required: yes

Specify an action type. The supported value is expire.

## Security in Amazon Elastic Container Registry

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center
and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive

organizations.

[Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The shared responsibility model describes](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud:

- Security of the cloud â AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS

services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third[party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)
[compliance programs. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to Amazon ECR, see](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)
[AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program.](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)

- Security in the cloud â Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You

are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your companyâs
requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.

This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when
using Amazon ECR. The following topics show you how to configure Amazon ECR to meet your
security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use other AWS services that help you to
monitor and secure your Amazon ECR resources.

**Topics**

- Identity and Access Management for Amazon Elastic Container Registry

### Identity and Access Management for Amazon Elastic Container Registry

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely
control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in)

Identity and Access Management API Version 2015-09-21 165


-----

and authorized (have permissions) to use Amazon ECR resources. IAM is an AWS service that you
can use with no additional charge.

**Topics**

- Audience

- Authenticating with identities

- Managing access using policies

- How Amazon Elastic Container Registry works with IAM

- Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy examples

- Using Tag-Based Access Control

- AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Registry

- Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECR

- Troubleshooting Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity and Access

#### Audience

How you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) differs, depending on the work that you
do in Amazon ECR.

**Service user â If you use the Amazon ECR service to do your job, then your administrator provides**
you with the credentials and permissions that you need. As you use more Amazon ECR features to
do your work, you might need additional permissions. Understanding how access is managed can
help you request the right permissions from your administrator. If you cannot access a feature in
Amazon ECR, see Troubleshooting Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity and Access.

**Service administrator â If you're in charge of Amazon ECR resources at your company, you**
probably have full access to Amazon ECR. It's your job to determine which Amazon ECR features
and resources your service users should access. You must then submit requests to your IAM
administrator to change the permissions of your service users. Review the information on this page
to understand the basic concepts of IAM. To learn more about how your company can use IAM with
Amazon ECR, see How Amazon Elastic Container Registry works with IAM.

**IAM administrator â If you're an IAM administrator, you might want to learn details about how**
you can write policies to manage access to Amazon ECR. To view example Amazon ECR identitybased policies that you can use in IAM, see Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy
examples.

#### Authenticating with identities

Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. You must be
_authenticated (signed in to AWS) as the AWS account root user, as an IAM user, or by assuming an_
IAM role.

You can sign in to AWS as a federated identity by using credentials provided through an identity
source. AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center) users, your company's single sign-on
authentication, and your Google or Facebook credentials are examples of federated identities.
When you sign in as a federated identity, your administrator previously set up identity federation
using IAM roles. When you access AWS by using federation, you are indirectly assuming a role.

Depending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the
[AWS access portal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see How to sign in to your AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html)
[account in the AWS Sign-In User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html)

If you access AWS programmatically, AWS provides a software development kit (SDK) and a
command line interface (CLI) to cryptographically sign your requests by using your credentials. If
you don't use AWS tools, you must sign requests yourself. For more information about using the
[recommended method to sign requests yourself, see AWS Signature Version 4 for API requests in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html)
the IAM User Guide.

Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might be required to provide additional
security information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor authentication
[(MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see Multi-factor authentication in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html)
[the AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide and AWS Multi-factor authentication in IAM in the IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html)

_Guide._

##### AWS account root user

When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to
all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and
is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.
We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your
root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For
[the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see Tasks that require root](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#root-user-tasks)
[user credentials in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#root-user-tasks)

-----

##### IAM users and groups

[An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html)
or application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating
IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. However, if you have
specific use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate
[access keys. For more information, see Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials)
[term credentials in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials)

[An IAM group is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users. You can't sign in as a group. You](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html)
can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier
to manage for large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named IAMAdmins and give
that group permissions to administer IAM resources.

Users are different from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but
a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Users have permanent long-term
[credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. To learn more, see Use cases for IAM users in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/gs-identities-iam-users.html)
the IAM User Guide.

##### IAM roles

[An IAM role is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions. It is similar to an](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)
IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person. To temporarily assume an IAM role in the
[AWS Management Console, you can switch from a user to an IAM role (console). You can assume a](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html)
role by calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information
[about methods for using roles, see Methods to assume a role in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage-assume.html)

IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:

- Federated user access â To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role

and define permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity

-----

- Cross-account access â You can use an IAM role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a

different account to access resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant crossaccount access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource
(instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the difference between roles and resource-based
[policies for cross-account access, see Cross account resource access in IAM in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html)

- Cross-service access â Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when

you make a call in a service, it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or
store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this using the calling principal's permissions,
using a service role, or using a service-linked role.

 - Forward access sessions (FAS) â When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in

AWS, you are considered a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an
action that then initiates another action in a different service. FAS uses the permissions of the
principal calling an AWS service, combined with the requesting AWS service to make requests
to downstream services. FAS requests are only made when a service receives a request that
requires interactions with other AWS services or resources to complete. In this case, you must
have permissions to perform both actions. For policy details when making FAS requests, see
[Forward access sessions.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_forward_access_sessions.html)

[â¢ Service role â A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)

behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For
[more information, see Create a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html)
_Guide._

 - Service-linked role â A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS

service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked
roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can

view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

- Applications running on Amazon EC2 â You can use an IAM role to manage temporary

credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API
requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role
to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile
that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that
[are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Use an](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html)

-----

#### Managing access using policies

You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AWS identities or resources.
A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their
permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal (user, root user, or role session) makes
a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most
policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about the structure and
[contents of JSON policy documents, see Overview of JSON policies in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json)

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which
**principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.**

By default, users and roles have no permissions. To grant users permission to perform actions on
the resources that they need, an IAM administrator can create IAM policies. The administrator can
then add the IAM policies to roles, and users can assume the roles.

IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the

operation. For example, suppose that you have a policy that allows the iam:GetRole action. A
user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or
the AWS API.

##### Identity-based policies

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity,
such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These policies control what actions users and roles can
perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based
[policy, see Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html)

Identity-based policies can be further categorized as inline policies or managed policies. Inline
policies are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. Managed policies are standalone
policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. Managed
policies include AWS managed policies and customer managed policies. To learn how to choose
[between a managed policy or an inline policy, see Choose between managed policies and inline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-choosing-managed-or-inline.html)
[policies in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-choosing-managed-or-inline.html)

##### Resource-based policies

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of
resource-based policies are IAM role trust policies and Amazon S3 bucket policies. In services that
support resource-based policies, service administrators can use them to control access to a specific

Managing access using policies API Version 2015-09-21 170


-----

resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions a specified
[principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must specify a principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html)
in a resource-based policy. Principals can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS
services.

Resource-based policies are inline policies that are located in that service. You can't use AWS
managed policies from IAM in a resource-based policy.

##### Other policy types

AWS supports additional, less-common policy types. These policy types can set the maximum
permissions granted to you by the more common policy types.

- Permissions boundaries â A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set

the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity (IAM user
or role). You can set a permissions boundary for an entity. The resulting permissions are the
intersection of an entity's identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. Resource-based

policies that specify the user or role in the Principal field are not limited by the permissions
boundary. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information
[about permissions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html)

- Service control policies (SCPs) â SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions

for an organization or organizational unit (OU) in AWS Organizations. AWS Organizations is a
service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts that your business owns. If
you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to
any or all of your accounts. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including
[each AWS account root user. For more information about Organizations and SCPs, see Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)
[control policies in the AWS Organizations User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)

- Resource control policies (RCPs) â RCPs are JSON policies that you can use to set the maximum

available permissions for resources in your accounts without updating the IAM policies attached
to each resource that you own. The RCP limits permissions for resources in member accounts
and can impact the effective permissions for identities, including the AWS account root
user, regardless of whether they belong to your organization. For more information about
[Organizations and RCPs, including a list of AWS services that support RCPs, see Resource control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html)
[policies (RCPs) in the AWS Organizations User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html)

- Session policies â Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you

programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user. The resulting session's
permissions are the intersection of the user or role's identity-based policies and the session

Managing access using policies API Version 2015-09-21 171


-----

policies. Permissions can also come from a resource-based policy. An explicit deny in any of these
[policies overrides the allow. For more information, see Session policies in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)

##### Multiple policy types

When multiple types of policies apply to a request, the resulting permissions are more complicated
to understand. To learn how AWS determines whether to allow a request when multiple policy
[types are involved, see Policy evaluation logic in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html)

#### How Amazon Elastic Container Registry works with IAM

Before you use IAM to manage access to Amazon ECR, you should understand what IAM features
are available to use with Amazon ECR. To get a high-level view of how Amazon ECR and other AWS
[services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html)

**Topics**

- Amazon ECR Identity-based policies

- Amazon ECR resource-based policies

- Authorization based on Amazon ECR tags

- Amazon ECR IAM roles

##### Amazon ECR Identity-based policies

With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well
as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon ECR supports specific actions,
resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see
[IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html)

**Actions**

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which
**principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.**

The Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny
access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation.
There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have a matching API
operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These
additional actions are called dependent actions.

How Amazon Elastic Container Registry works with IAM API Version 2015-09-21 172


-----

Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.

Policy actions in Amazon ECR use the following prefix before the action: ecr:. For example,
to grant someone permission to create an Amazon ECR repository with the Amazon ECR
```
CreateRepository API operation, you include the ecr:CreateRepository action in their

```
policy. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon ECR
defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:
```
 "Action": [
    "ecr:action1",
    "ecr:action2"

```
You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin

with the word Describe, include the following action:
```
 "Action": "ecr:Describe*"

```
[To see a list of Amazon ECR actions, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Elastic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonelasticcontainerregistry.html)
[Container Registry in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonelasticcontainerregistry.html)

**Resources**

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which
**principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.**

The Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies.

Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice,
[specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html)
a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.

For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard
(*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.
```
 "Resource": "*"

```
An Amazon ECR repository resource has the following ARN:

How Amazon Elastic Container Registry works with IAM API Version 2015-09-21 173


-----

```
arn:${Partition}:ecr:${Region}:${Account}:repository/${Repository-name}

```

[For more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
[Service Namespaces.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)

For example, to specify the my-repo repository in the us-east-1 Region in your statement, use
the following ARN:
```
 "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/my-repo"

```
To specify all repositories that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):
```
 "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/*"

```
To specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.
```
 "Resource": [
    "resource1",
    "resource2"

```
[To see a list of Amazon ECR resource types and their ARNs, see Resources Defined by Amazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonelasticcontainerregistry.html#amazonelasticcontainerregistry-resources-for-iam-policies)
[Elastic Container Registry in the IAM User Guide. To learn with which actions you can specify the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonelasticcontainerregistry.html#amazonelasticcontainerregistry-resources-for-iam-policies)
[ARN of each resource, see Actions Defined by Amazon Elastic Container Registry.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonelasticcontainerregistry.html#amazonelasticcontainerregistry-actions-as-permissions)

**Condition keys**

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which
**principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.**

The Condition element (or Condition _block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement_

is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use
[condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html)
the request.

If you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single
```
Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple

```
values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of
the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.

How Amazon Elastic Container Registry works with IAM API Version 2015-09-21 174


-----

You can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant
an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more
[information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html)

AWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all AWS global

[condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html)

Amazon ECR defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using some global condition
[keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html)
_Guide._

Most Amazon ECR actions support the aws:ResourceTag and ecr:ResourceTag condition keys.
For more information, see Using Tag-Based Access Control.

Identity-based policy examples.

##### Amazon ECR resource-based policies

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that specify what actions a specified principal
can perform on an Amazon ECR resource and under what conditions. Amazon ECR supports

resource-based permissions policies for Amazon ECR repositories. Resource-based policies let you
grant usage permission to other accounts on a per-resource basis. You can also use a resourcebased policy to allow an AWS service to access your Amazon ECR repositories.

To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities in another
[account as the principal in a resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account principal to a resource-](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html)
based policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship. When the principal and the resource
are in different AWS accounts, you must also grant the principal entity permission to access the
resource. Grant permission by attaching an identity-based policy to the entity. However, if a
resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based
[policy is required. For more information, see How IAM Roles Differ from Resource-based Policies in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html)
the IAM User Guide.

How Amazon Elastic Container Registry works with IAM API Version 2015-09-21 175


-----

The Amazon ECR service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a repository policy,
which is attached to a repository. This policy defines which principal entities (accounts, users, roles,
and federated users) can perform actions on the repository. To learn how to attach a resourcebased policy to a repository, see Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

**Note**

In an Amazon ECR repository policy, the policy element Sid supports additional characters
and spacing not supported in IAM policies.

**Examples**

To view examples of Amazon ECR resource-based policies, see Private repository policy examples in
Amazon ECR,

##### Authorization based on Amazon ECR tags

You can attach tags to Amazon ECR resources or pass tags in a request to Amazon ECR. To control
[access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)
```
ecr:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.

```
For more information about tagging Amazon ECR resources, see Tagging a private repository in
Amazon ECR.

that resource, see Using Tag-Based Access Control.

##### Amazon ECR IAM roles

[An IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)

**Using Temporary Credentials with Amazon ECR**

You can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a
cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations
[such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html)

Amazon ECR supports using temporary credentials.

[Service-linked roles allow AWS services to access resources in other services to complete an action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role)
on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An
IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

Amazon ECR supports service-linked roles. For more information, see Using service-linked roles for
Amazon ECR.

#### Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy examples

By default, users and roles don't have permission to create or modify Amazon ECR resources. They
also can't perform tasks by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI), or AWS API. To grant users permission to perform actions on the resources that they
need, an IAM administrator can create IAM policies. The administrator can then add the IAM
policies to roles, and users can assume the roles.

##### Policy Best Practices

Identity-based policies determine whether someone can create, access, or delete Amazon ECR
resources in your account. These actions can incur costs for your AWS account. When you create or
edit identity-based policies, follow these guidelines and recommendations:

Identity-based policy examples API Version 2015-09-21 177


-----

- Get started with AWS managed policies and move toward least-privilege permissions â To

get started granting permissions to your users and workloads, use the AWS managed policies
that grant permissions for many common use cases. They are available in your AWS account. We
recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining AWS customer managed policies
[that are specific to your use cases. For more information, see AWS managed policies or AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies)
[managed policies for job functions in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html)

- Apply least-privilege permissions â When you set permissions with IAM policies, grant only the

permissions required to perform a task. You do this by defining the actions that can be taken on
specific resources under specific conditions, also known as least-privilege permissions. For more
[information about using IAM to apply permissions, see Policies and permissions in IAM in the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)
_IAM User Guide._

- Use conditions in IAM policies to further restrict access â You can add a condition to your

policies to limit access to actions and resources. For example, you can write a policy condition to
specify that all requests must be sent using SSL. You can also use conditions to grant access to
service actions if they are used through a specific AWS service, such as AWS CloudFormation. For
[more information, see IAM JSON policy elements: Condition in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)

- Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate your IAM policies to ensure secure and functional

**permissions â IAM Access Analyzer validates new and existing policies so that the policies**
adhere to the IAM policy language (JSON) and IAM best practices. IAM Access Analyzer provides
more than 100 policy checks and actionable recommendations to help you author secure and
[functional policies. For more information, see Validate policies with IAM Access Analyzer in the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-validation.html)
_IAM User Guide._

- Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) â If you have a scenario that requires IAM users or

a root user in your AWS account, turn on MFA for additional security. To require MFA when API

[operations are called, add MFA conditions to your policies. For more information, see Secure API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html)
[access with MFA in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html)

##### Using the Amazon ECR console

To access the Amazon Elastic Container Registry console, you must have a minimum set of
permissions. These permissions must allow you to list and view details about the Amazon ECR
resources in your AWS account. If you create an identity-based policy that is more restrictive than

Identity-based policy examples API Version 2015-09-21 178


-----

the minimum required permissions, the console won't function as intended for entities (users or
roles) with that policy.

To ensure that those entities can still use the Amazon ECR console, add the
```
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly AWS managed policy to the entities. For more

```
[information, see Adding Permissions to a User in the IAM User Guide:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console)
```
 {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
     {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
         "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
         "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",

         "ecr:GetRepositoryPolicy",
         "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
         "ecr:ListImages",
         "ecr:DescribeImages",
         "ecr:BatchGetImage",
         "ecr:GetLifecyclePolicy",
         "ecr:GetLifecyclePolicyPreview",

         "ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings"
       ],
       "Resource": "*"

   ]
 }

```
You don't need to allow minimum console permissions for users that are making calls only to the
AWS CLI or the AWS API. Instead, allow access to only the actions that match the API operation
that you're trying to perform.

##### Allow Users to View Their Own Permissions

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and
managed policies that are attached to their user identity. This policy includes permissions to
complete this action on the console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or AWS API.

   }
  ]
}

```

#### Using Tag-Based Access Control

The Amazon ECR CreateRepository API action enables you to specify tags when you create the
repository. For more information, see Tagging a private repository in Amazon ECR.

To enable users to tag repositories on creation, they must have permissions to use the action that

creates the resource (for example, ecr:CreateRepository). If tags are specified in the resource
creating action, Amazon performs additional authorization on the ecr:CreateRepository
action to verify if users have permissions to create tags.

You can use tag-based access control through IAM policies. The following are examples.

The following policy would only allow a user to create or tag a repository as
```
key=environment,value=dev.
 {

```

#### AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Registry

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS
managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can
start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your
specific use cases because they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you
[reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies)
cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the
permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users,
groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed
policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing
services.

[For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies)

Amazon ECR provides several managed policies that you can attach to IAM identities or to Amazon
EC2 instances. These managed policies allow differing levels of control over access to Amazon ECR
resources and API operations. For more information about each API operation mentioned in these
[policies, see Actions in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry API Reference.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html)

AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

```
You can attach the AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess policy to your IAM identities.

You can use this managed policy as a starting point to create your own IAM policy based on
your specific requirements. For example, you can create a policy specifically for providing
a user or role with full administrator access to manage the use of Amazon ECR. With the
[Amazon ECR Lifecycle Policies feature, you can specify the lifecycle management of images in a](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html)
repository. Lifecycle policy events are reported as CloudTrail events. Amazon ECR is integrated
with AWS CloudTrail so it can display your lifecycle policy events directly in the Amazon ECR

console. The AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess managed IAM policy includes the
```
cloudtrail:LookupEvents permission to facilitate this behavior.

```
**Permissions details**

This policy includes the following permissions:

- ecr â Allows principals full access to all Amazon ECR APIs.

- cloudtrail â Allows principals to looks up management events or AWS CloudTrail Insights

events that are captured by CloudTrail.

The AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess policy is as follows.

AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser

```
You can attach the AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser policy to your IAM identities.

This policy grants administrative permissions that allow IAM users to read and write to repositories,

but doesn't allow them to delete repositories or change the policy documents that are applied to
them.

**Permissions details**

This policy includes the following permissions:

- ecr â Allows principals to read and write to repositories, as well as read lifecycle policies.

#### Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECR

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
[service-linked roles to provide the permissions necessary to use the replication and pull through](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role)
cache features. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Amazon
ECR. The service-linked role is predefined by Amazon ECR. It includes all of the permissions that
the service requires to support the replication and pull through cache features for your private

Using service-linked roles API Version 2015-09-21 192


-----

registry. After you configure replication or pull through cache for your registry, a service-linked
role is created automatically on your behalf. For more information, see Private registry settings in
Amazon ECR.

A service-linked role makes setting up replication and pull through cache with Amazon ECR easier.
This is because, by using it, you donât have to manually add all the necessary permissions. Amazon
ECR defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Amazon
ECR can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions
policy. The permissions policy can't be attached to any other IAM entity.

You can delete the corresponding service-linked role only after disabling either replication or pull
through cache on your registry. This ensures that you don't inadvertently remove the permissions
Amazon ECR requires for these features.

[For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html)
[with IAM. On this linked-to page, look for the services that have Yes in the Service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html)
column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the relevant service-linked role documentation for that
service.

##### Supported Regions for Amazon ECR service-linked roles

Amazon ECR supports using service-linked roles in all of the Regions where the Amazon ECR
[service is available. For more information about Amazon ECR Region availability, see AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)
[and Endpoints.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)

##### Amazon ECR service-linked role for replication

Amazon ECR uses a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForECRReplication that allows
Amazon ECR to replicate images across multiple accounts.

Using service-linked roles API Version 2015-09-21 193


-----

**Service-linked role permissions for Amazon ECR**

The AWSServiceRoleForECRReplication service-linked role trusts the following services to assume
the role:

- replication.ecr.amazonaws.com

The following ECRReplicationServiceRolePolicy role permissions policy allows Amazon ECR
to use the following actions on resources:
```
 {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
     {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
         "ecr:CreateRepository",
         "ecr:ReplicateImage"
       ],
       "Resource": "*"
     }
   ]
 }

```
**Note**

The ReplicateImage is an internal API that Amazon ECR uses for replication and can't be
called directly.

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (for example a user, group, or role)
[to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions)
[Permissions in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions)

**Creating a service-linked role for Amazon ECR**

You don't need to manually create the Amazon ECR service-linked role. When you configure
replication settings for your registry in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS
API, Amazon ECR creates the service-linked role for you.

Using service-linked roles API Version 2015-09-21 194


-----

If you delete this service-linked role and need to create it again, you can use the same process to
recreate the role in your account. When you configure replication settings for your registry, Amazon
ECR creates the service-linked role for you again.

**Editing a service-linked role for Amazon ECR**

Amazon ECR doesn't allow manually editing the AWSServiceRoleForECRReplication service-linked
role. After you create a service-linked role, you can't change the name of the role because various
entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For
[more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role)

**Deleting the service-linked role for Amazon ECR**

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend
that you delete that role. That way, you donât have an unused entity that isn't actively monitored

or maintained. However, you must remove the replication configuration for your registry in every
Region before you can manually delete the service-linked role.

**Note**

If you try to delete resources while the Amazon ECR service is still using the roles, your
delete action might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try again.

**To delete Amazon ECR resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForECRReplication**

1. [Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region your replication configuration is set on.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Private registry.

4. On the Private registry page, on the Replication configuration section, choose Edit.

5. To delete all of your replication rules, choose Delete all. This step requires confirmation.

**To manually delete the service-linked role using IAM**

Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the
**[AWSServiceRoleForECRReplication service-linked role. For more information, see Deleting a](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role)**

##### Amazon ECR service-linked role for pull through cache

Amazon ECR uses a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForECRPullThroughCache

which gives permission for Amazon ECR to perform actions on your behalf to complete pull

through cache actions. For more information about pull through cache, see Templates to control
repositories created during a pull through cache or replication action.

**Service-linked role permissions for Amazon ECR**

The AWSServiceRoleForECRPullThroughCache service-linked role trusts the following service to
assume the role.

- pullthroughcache.ecr.amazonaws.com

**Permissions details**

The AWSECRPullThroughCache_ServiceRolePolicy permissions policy is attached to the
service-linked role. This managed policy grants Amazon ECR permission to perform the following

actions. For more information, see AWSECRPullThroughCache_ServiceRolePolicy.

- ecr â Allows the Amazon ECR service to push images to a private repository.

- secretsmanager:GetSecretValue â Allows the Amazon ECR service to retrieve the

encrypted contents of an AWS Secrets Manager secret. This is required when using a pull through
cache rule to cache images from an upstream registry that requires authentication in your private

registry. This permission applies only to secrets with the ecr-pullthroughcache/ name
prefix.

The AWSECRPullThroughCache_ServiceRolePolicy policy contains the following JSON.
```

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (for example a user, group, or role)
[to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions)

**Creating a service-linked role for Amazon ECR**

You don't need to manually create the Amazon ECR service-linked role for pull through cache.
When you create a pull through cache rule for your private registry in the AWS Management
Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Amazon ECR creates the service-linked role for you.

If you delete this service-linked role and need to create it again, you can use the same process
to recreate the role in your account. When you create a pull through cache rule for your private
registry, Amazon ECR creates the service-linked role for you again if it doesn't already exist.

**Editing a service-linked role for Amazon ECR**

Amazon ECR doesn't allow manually editing the AWSServiceRoleForECRPullThroughCache
service-linked role. After the service-linked role is created, you can't change the name of the role
because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role
[using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role)

**Deleting the service-linked role for Amazon ECR**

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend
that you delete that role. That way, you donât have an unused entity that isn't actively monitored
or maintained. However, you must delete the pull through cache rules for your registry in every
Region before you can manually delete the service-linked role.

**Note**

If you try to delete resources while the Amazon ECR service is still using the role, your
delete action might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try again.

##### Amazon ECR service-linked role for repository creation templates

Amazon ECR uses a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForECRTemplate which gives
permission for Amazon ECR to perform actions on your behalf to complete repository creation
template actions.

**Service-linked role permissions for Amazon ECR**

The AWSServiceRoleForECRTemplate service-linked role trusts the following service to assume
the role.

#### Troubleshooting Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity and Access

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with Amazon ECR and IAM.

- I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon ECR resources

##### I Am Not Authorized to Perform an Action in Amazon ECR

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your policies must be
updated to allow you to perform the action.

The following example error occurs when the mateojackson IAM user tries to use the console

to view details about a fictional my-example-widget resource but doesn't have the fictional
```
ecr:GetWidget permissions.
 User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform:
 ecr:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget

```
In this case, the policy for the mateojackson user must be updated to allow access to the my```
example-widget resource by using the ecr:GetWidget action.

```
If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided
you with your sign-in credentials.

##### I Am Not Authorized to Perform iam:PassRole

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the iam:PassRole action, your
policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to Amazon ECR.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new
service role or service-linked role. To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the
service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named marymajor tries to use the console
to perform an action in Amazon ECR. However, the action requires the service to have permissions
that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service.
```
 User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform:
 iam:PassRole

```

##### I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon ECR resources

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to
access your resources. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role. For services that support
resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant people
access to your resources.

### Data protection in Amazon ECR

[The AWS shared responsibility model applies to data protection in Amazon Elastic Container](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
Service. As described in this model, AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure
that runs all of the AWS Cloud. You are responsible for maintaining control over your content
that is hosted on this infrastructure. You are also responsible for the security configuration and
management tasks for the AWS services that you use. For more information about data privacy,
[see the Data Privacy FAQ. For information about data protection in Europe, see the AWS Shared](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/)
[Responsibility Model and GDPR blog post on the AWS Security Blog.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr/)

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account credentials and set
up individual users with AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

That way, each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties. We also
recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.

- Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail. For information about using CloudTrail

[trails to capture AWS activities, see Working with CloudTrail trails in the AWS CloudTrail User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-trails.html)
_Guide._

- Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services.

- Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering and

securing sensitive data that is stored in Amazon S3.

- If you require FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through a

command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. For more information about the available
[FIPS endpoints, see Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3.](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/)

We strongly recommend that you never put confidential or sensitive information, such as your
customers' email addresses, into tags or free-form text fields such as a Name field. This includes
when you work with Amazon ECS or other AWS services using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS
SDKs. Any data that you enter into tags or free-form text fields used for names may be used for
billing or diagnostic logs. If you provide a URL to an external server, we strongly recommend that
you do not include credentials information in the URL to validate your request to that server.

#### Encryption at rest

**Important**

Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS (DSSE-KMS) is only available in the AWS
GovCloud (US) Regions.

Amazon ECR stores images in Amazon S3 buckets that Amazon ECR manages. By default, Amazon
ECR uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys which encrypts your
data at rest using an AES-256 encryption algorithm. This does not require any action on your part

[Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple Storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)
_Service User Guide._

For more control over the encryption for your Amazon ECR repositories, you can use server-side

encryption with KMS keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). When you use AWS
KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the default AWS managed key, which is managed
by Amazon ECR, or specify your own KMS key (referred to as a customer managed key). For more
[information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys Stored in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)
[(SSE-KMS) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)

You can choose to apply two layers of encryption to your Amazon ECR images using dual-layer
server-side encryption with AWS KMS (DSSE-KMS). DSSE-KMS option is similar to SSE-KMS, but
[applies two individual layers of encryption instead of one layer. For more information, see Using](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingDSSEncryption.html)
[dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS).](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingDSSEncryption.html)

Each Amazon ECR repository has an encryption configuration, which is set when the repository is
created. You can use different encryption configurations on each repository. For more information,
see Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images.

When a repository is created with AWS KMS encryption enabled, a KMS key is used to encrypt the
contents of the repository. Moreover, Amazon ECR adds an AWS KMS grant to the KMS key with the
Amazon ECR repository as the grantee principal.

The following provides a high-level understanding of how Amazon ECR is integrated with AWS
KMS to encrypt and decrypt your repositories:

[1. When creating a repository, Amazon ECR sends a DescribeKey call to AWS KMS to validate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html)

and retrieve the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key specified in the encryption
configuration.

[2. Amazon ECR sends two CreateGrant requests to AWS KMS to create grants on the KMS key to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGrant.html)

allow Amazon ECR to encrypt and decrypt data using the data key.

[3. When pushing an image, a GenerateDataKey request is made to AWS KMS that specifies the KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext.html)

key to use for encrypting the image layer and manifest.

4. AWS KMS generates a new data key, encrypts it under the specified KMS key, and sends the

encrypted data key to be stored with the image layer metadata and the image manifest.

[5. When pulling an image, a Decrypt request is made to AWS KMS, specifying the encrypted data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html)

key.

Encryption at rest API Version 2015-09-21 204


-----

6. AWS KMS decrypts the encrypted data key and sends the decrypted data key to Amazon S3.

7. The data key is used to decrypt the image layer before the image layer being pulled.

[8. When a repository is deleted, Amazon ECR sends two RetireGrant requests to AWS KMS to retire](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_RetireGrant.html)

the grants created for the repository.

##### Considerations

The following points should be considered when using AWS KMS based encryption (SSE-KMS or
DSSE-KMS) with Amazon ECR.

- If you create your Amazon ECR repository with KMS encryption and you do not specify a KMS

key, Amazon ECR uses an AWS managed key with the alias aws/ecr by default. This KMS key is
created in your account the first time that you create a repository with KMS encryption enabled.

- Repository Encryption Configuration can't be changed after a repository is created.

- When you use KMS encryption with your own KMS key, the key must exist in the same Region as

your repository.

- The grants that Amazon ECR creates on your behalf should not be revoked. If you revoke the

grant that gives Amazon ECR permission to use the AWS KMS keys in your account, Amazon ECR
cannot access this data, encrypt new images pushed to the repository, or decrypt them when
they are pulled. When you revoke a grant for Amazon ECR, the change occurs immediately. To
revoke access rights, you should delete the repository rather than revoking the grant. When a
repository is deleted, Amazon ECR retires the grants on your behalf.

[â¢ There is a cost associated with using AWS KMS keys. For more information, see AWS Key](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/)

[Management Service pricing.](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/)

- There is a cost associated with using dual-layer server-side encryption. For more inforation, see

[Amazon ECR pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing/)

##### Required IAM permissions

When creating or deleting an Amazon ECR repository with server-side encryption using AWS KMS,
the permissions required depend on the specific KMS key you are using.

**Required IAM permissions when using the AWS managed key for Amazon ECR**

By default, when AWS KMS encryption is enabled for an Amazon ECR repository but no KMS key
is specified, the AWS managed key for Amazon ECR is used. When the AWS-managed KMS key

Encryption at rest API Version 2015-09-21 205


-----

for Amazon ECR is used to encrypt a repository, any principal that has permission to create a
repository can also enable AWS KMS encryption on the repository. However, the IAM principal that

deletes the repository must have the kms:RetireGrant permission. This enables the retirement
of the grants that were added to the AWS KMS key when the repository was created.

The following example IAM policy can be added as an inline policy to a user to ensure they have
the minimum permissions needed to delete a repository that has encryption enabled. The KMS key
used to encrypt the repository can be specified using the resource parameter.
```
 {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Id": "ecr-kms-permissions",
   "Statement": [
     {
       "Sid": "AllowAccessToRetireTheGrantsAssociatedWithTheKey",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
         "kms:RetireGrant"
       ],
       "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us west-2:111122223333:key/b8d9ae76-080c-4043-92EXAMPLE"
     }
   ]
 }

```
**Required IAM permissions when using a customer managed key**

When creating a repository with AWS KMS encryption enabled using a customer managed key,

there are required permissions for both the KMS keypolicy and the IAM policy for the user or role
creating the repository.

When creating your own KMS key, you can either use the default key policy AWS KMS creates or
you can specify your own. To ensure that the customer managed key remains manageable by the
account owner, the key policy for the KMS key should allow all AWS KMS actions for the root user
of the account. Additional scoped permissions may be added to the key policy but at minimum the
root user should be given permissions to manage the KMS key. To allow the KMS key to be used
[only for requests that originate in Amazon ECR, you can use the kms:ViaService condition key with](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-via-service)

the ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com value.

Encryption at rest API Version 2015-09-21 206

The following example key policy gives the AWS account (root user) that owns the KMS key full
[access to the KMS key. For more information about this example key policy, see Allows access to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam)

       },
       "Action": "kms:*",
       "Resource": "*"
     }
   ]
 }

```
The IAM user, IAM role, or AWS account creating your repositories must have the
```
kms:CreateGrant, kms:RetireGrant, and kms:DescribeKey permission in addition to the

```
necessary Amazon ECR permissions.

**Note**

The kms:RetireGrant permission must be added to the IAM policy of the user or role

creating the repository. The kms:CreateGrant and kms:DescribeKey permissions can
be added to either the key policy for the KMS key or the IAM policy of user or role creating
[the repository. For more information on how AWS KMS permissions work, see AWS KMS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html)
[permissions: Actions and resources reference in the AWS Key Management Service Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html)
_Guide._

The following example IAM policy can be added as an inline policy to a user to ensure they have
the minimum permissions needed to create a repository with encryption enabled and delete the
repository when they are finished with it. The AWS KMS key used to encrypt the repository can be
specified using the resource parameter.

**Allow a user to list KMS keys in the console when creating a repository**

When using the Amazon ECR console to create a repository, you can grant permissions to enable
a user to list the customer managed KMS keys in the Region when enabling encryption for the
repository. The following IAM policy example shows the permissions needed to list your KMS keys
and aliases when using the console.
```
 {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

##### Monitoring Amazon ECR interaction with AWS KMS

You can use AWS CloudTrail to track the requests that Amazon ECR sends to AWS KMS on your
behalf. The log entries in the CloudTrail log contain an encryption context key to make them more
easily identifiable.

**Amazon ECR encryption context**

An encryption context is a set of keyâvalue pairs that contains arbitrary nonsecret data. When you
include an encryption context in a request to encrypt data, AWS KMS cryptographically binds
the encryption context to the encrypted data. To decrypt the data, you must pass in the same
encryption context.

[In its GenerateDataKey and Decrypt requests to AWS KMS, Amazon ECR uses an encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html)
with two nameâvalue pairs that identify the repository and Amazon S3 bucket being used. This is
shown in the following example. The names do not vary, but combined encryption context values
will be different for each value.
```
 "encryptionContext": {
   "aws:s3:arn": "arn:aws:s3:::us-west-2-starport-manifest-bucket/EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef fedc-ba987BUCKET1/
 sha256:a7766145a775d39e53a713c75b6fd6d318740e70327aaa3ed5d09e0ef33fc3df",
   "aws:ecr:arn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:111122223333:repository/repository-name"
 }

```
You can use the encryption context to identify these cryptographic operation in audit records and
[logs, such as AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and as a condition for authorization in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
policies and grants.

The Amazon ECR encryption context consists of two name-value pairs.

- aws:s3:arn â The first nameâvalue pair identifies the bucket. The key is aws:s3:arn. The value

is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3 bucket.
```
  "aws:s3:arn": "ARN of an Amazon S3 bucket"

```
For example, if the ARN of the bucket is arn:aws:s3:::us-west-2```
 starport-manifest-bucket/EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987BUCKET1/
 sha256:a7766145a775d39e53a713c75b6fd6d318740e70327aaa3ed5d09e0ef33fc3df,

```
the encryption context would include the following pair.

Encryption at rest API Version 2015-09-21 209


-----

```
"arn:aws:s3:::us-west-2-starport-manifest-bucket/EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedcba987BUCKET1/sha256:a7766145a775d39e53a713c75b6fd6d318740e70327aaa3ed5d09e0ef33fc3df"

```


- aws:ecr:arn â The second nameâvalue pair identifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the

repository. The key is aws:ecr:arn. The value is the ARN of the repository.
```
  "aws:ecr:arn": "ARN of an Amazon ECR repository"

```
For example, if the ARN of the repository is arn:aws:ecr:us```
 west-2:111122223333:repository/repository-name, the encryption context would

```
include the following pair.
```
  "aws:ecr:arn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:111122223333:repository/repository-name"

##### Troubleshooting

```
When deleting an Amazon ECR repository with the console, if the repository is successfully deleted
but Amazon ECR is unable to retire the grants added to your KMS key for your repository, you will
receive the following error.
```
 The repository [{repository-name}] has been deleted successfully but the grants created
 by the kmsKey [{kms_key}] failed to be retired

```
When this occurs, you can retire the AWS KMS grants for the repository yourself.

**To retire AWS KMS grants for a repository manually**

1. List the grants for the AWS KMS key used for the repository. The key-id value is included in

the error you receive from the console. You can also use the list-keys command to list both
the AWS managed keys and customer managed KMS keys in a specific Region in your account.
```
   aws kms list-grants \
      --key-id b8d9ae76-080c-4043-9237-c815bfc21dfc
      --region us-west-2

```
Encryption at rest API Version 2015-09-21 210


-----

The output include an EncryptionContextSubset with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
of your repository. This can be used to determine which grant added to the key is the one you

want to retire. The GrantId value will be used when retiring the grant in the next step.

2. Retire each grant for the AWS KMS key added for the repository. Replace the value for
```
  GrantId with the ID of the grant from the output of the previous step.
   aws kms retire-grant \
      --key-id b8d9ae76-080c-4043-9237-c815bfc21dfc \
      --grant-id GrantId \
      --region us-west-2

### Infrastructure Security in Amazon Elastic Container Registry

As a managed service, Amazon Elastic Container Registry is protected by AWS global network
security. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see
[AWS Cloud Security. To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)
[security, see Infrastructure Protection in Security Pillar AWS WellâArchitected Framework.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html)

You use AWS published API calls to access Amazon ECR through the network. Clients must support
the following:

- Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) or

ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later
support these modes.

Infrastructure Security API Version 2015-09-21 212


-----

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is
[associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html)
generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.

You can call these API operations from any network location, but Amazon ECR does support

resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address. You
can also use Amazon ECR policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
(Amazon VPC) endpoints or specific VPCs. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given
Amazon ECR resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network. For more information,
see Amazon ECR interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink).

#### Amazon ECR interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)

You can improve the security posture of your VPC by configuring Amazon ECR to use an interface
VPC endpoint. VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you

to privately access Amazon ECR APIs through private IP addresses. AWS PrivateLink restricts all
network traffic between your VPC and Amazon ECR to the Amazon network. You don't need an
internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway.

[For more information about AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints, see VPC Endpoints in the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html)
_Amazon VPC User Guide._

##### Considerations for Amazon ECR VPC endpoints

Before you configure VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR, be aware of the following considerations.

- To allow your Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances to pull private images from

Amazon ECR, create the interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS. For more information, see
[Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints.html)
_Guide._

- Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that pull container images from Amazon ECR can restrict

access to the specific VPC their tasks use and to the VPC endpoint the service uses by adding
[condition keys to the task execution IAM role for the task. For more information, see Optional](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html)
[IAM Permissions for Fargate Tasks Pulling Amazon ECR Images over Interface Endpoints in the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html)
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide._

- The security group attached to the VPC endpoint must allow incoming connections on port 443

from the private subnet of the VPC.

- VPC endpoints currently don't support cross-Region requests. Ensure that you create your VPC

endpoints in the same Region where you plan to issue your API calls to Amazon ECR.

Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) API Version 2015-09-21 213


-----

- VPC endpoints currently don't support Amazon ECR Public repositories. Consider using a pull

through cache rule to host the public image in a private repository in the same Region as the
VPC endpoint. For more information, see Sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private
registry.

- VPC endpoints only support AWS provided DNS through Amazon Route 53. If you want to

[use your own DNS, you can use conditional DNS forwarding. For more information, see DHCP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html)
[Options Sets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html)

- If your containers have existing connections to Amazon S3, their connections might be

briefly interrupted when you add the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint. If you want to avoid this
interruption, create a new VPC that uses the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint and then migrate
your Amazon ECS cluster and its containers into the new VPC.

- When an image is pulled using a pull through cache rule for the first time, if you've configured

Amazon ECR to use an interface VPC endpoint using AWS PrivateLink then you need to create a
public subnet in the same VPC, with a NAT gateway, and then route all outbound traffic to the
internet from their private subnet to the NAT gateway in order for the pull to work. Subsequent
[image pulls don't require this. For more information, see Scenario: Access the internet from a](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html#public-nat-internet-access)
[private subnet in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html#public-nat-internet-access)

**Considerations for Windows images**

Images based on the Windows operating system include artifacts that are restricted by license
from being distributed. By default, when you push Windows images to an Amazon ECR repository,
the layers that include these artifacts are not pushed as they are considered foreign layers. When
the artifacts are provided by Microsoft, the foreign layers are retrieved from Microsoft Azure
infrastructure. For this reason, to enable your containers to pull these foreign layers from Azure
additional steps are needed beyond creating the VPC endpoints.

It is possible to override this behavior when pushing Windows images to Amazon ECR by using the
```
--allow-nondistributable-artifacts flag in the Docker daemon. When enabled, this flag

```
will push the licensed layers to Amazon ECR which enables these images to be pulled from Amazon
ECR via the VPC endpoint without additional access to Azure being required.

**Important**

Using the --allow-nondistributable-artifacts flag does not preclude your
obligation to comply with the terms of the Windows container base image license; you

Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) API Version 2015-09-21 214


-----

cannot post Windows content for public or third-party redistribution. Usage within your
own environment is allowed.


To enable the use of this flag for your Docker installation, you must modify the Docker daemon
configuration file which, depending on your Docker installation, can typically be configured in

settings or preferences menu under the Docker Engine section or by editing the C:\ProgramData
```
\docker\config\daemon.json file directly.

```
The following is an example of the required configuration. Replace the value with the repository
URI you are pushing images to.
```
 {
   "allow-nondistributable-artifacts": [
     "111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
   ]
 }

```
After modifying the Docker daemon configuration file, you must restart the Docker daemon before
attempting to push your image. Confirm the push worked by verifying that the base layer was
pushed to your repository.

**Note**

The base layers for Windows images are large. The layer size will result in a longer time
to push and additional storage costs in Amazon ECR for these images. For these reasons,
we recommend only using this option when it is strictly required to reduce build times and

ongoing storage costs. For example, the mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore
image is approximately 1.7 GiB in size when compressed in Amazon ECR.

##### Create the VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR

[To create the VPC endpoints for the Amazon ECR service, use the Creating an Interface Endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint)
procedure in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances require both Amazon ECR endpoints and the
Amazon S3 gateway endpoint.

Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) API Version 2015-09-21 215


-----

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 or later require both Amazon
ECR VPC endpoints and the Amazon S3 gateway endpoints.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that use platform version 1.3.0 or earlier only require

the com.amazonaws.region.ecr.dkr Amazon ECR VPC endpoint and the Amazon S3 gateway
endpoints.

**Note**

The order that the endpoints are created in doesn't matter.

**com.amazonaws.region.ecr.dkr**

This endpoint is used for the Docker Registry APIs. Docker client commands such as push and
```
  pull use this endpoint.

```
When you create this endpoint, you must enable a private DNS hostname. To do this, ensure
that the Enable Private DNS Name option is selected in the Amazon VPC console when you
create the VPC endpoint.

**com.amazonaws.region.ecr.api**

**Note**

The specified region represents the Region identifier for an AWS Region supported by

Amazon ECR, such as us-east-2 for the US East (Ohio) Region.

This endpoint is used for calls to the Amazon ECR API. API actions such as DescribeImages

and CreateRepository go to this endpoint.

When this endpoint is created, you have the option to enable a private DNS hostname. Enable
this setting by selecting Enable Private DNS Name in the VPC console when you create the VPC
endpoint. If you enable a private DNS hostname for the VPC endpoint, update your SDK or AWS
CLI to the latest version so that specifying an endpoint URL when using the SDK or AWS CLI
isn't necessary.

If you enable a private DNS hostname and are using an SDK or AWS CLI version released before

January 24, 2019, you must use the --endpoint-url parameter to specify the interface
endpoints. The following example shows the format for the endpoint URL.

Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) API Version 2015-09-21 216


-----

```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --endpoint-url https://
api.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

```

If you don't enable a private DNS hostname for the VPC endpoint, you must use the -```
  endpoint-url parameter specifying the VPC endpoint ID for the interface endpoint. The

```
following example shows the format for the endpoint URL.
```
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --endpoint-url
   https://VPC_endpoint_ID.api.ecr.region.vpce.amazonaws.com

##### Create the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint

```
For your Amazon ECS tasks to pull private images from Amazon ECR, you must create a gateway
endpoint for Amazon S3. The gateway endpoint is required because Amazon ECR uses Amazon S3
to store your image layers. When your containers download images from Amazon ECR, they must
access Amazon ECR to get the image manifest and then Amazon S3 to download the actual image
layers. The following is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3 bucket containing the
layers for each Docker image.
```
 arn:aws:s3:::prod-region-starport-layer-bucket/*

```
[Use the Creating a gateway endpoint procedure in the Amazon VPC User Guide to create the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-gateway.html#create-gateway-endpoint)
following Amazon S3 gateway endpoint for Amazon ECR. When creating the endpoint, be sure to
select the route tables for your VPC.

**com.amazonaws.region.s3**

The Amazon S3 gateway endpoint uses an IAM policy document to limit access to the service.
The Full Access policy can be used because any restrictions that you have put in your task IAM
roles or other IAM user policies still apply on top of this policy. If you want to limit Amazon
S3 bucket access to the minimum required permissions for using Amazon ECR, see Minimum
Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions for Amazon ECR.

**Minimum Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions for Amazon ECR**

The Amazon S3 gateway endpoint uses an IAM policy document to limit access to the service.
To allow only the minimum Amazon S3 bucket permissions for Amazon ECR, restrict access to

Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) API Version 2015-09-21 217


-----

the Amazon S3 bucket that Amazon ECR uses when you create the IAM policy document for the
endpoint.

The following table describes the Amazon S3 bucket policy permissions needed by Amazon ECR.

**Permission** **Description**

`arn:aws:s3:::prod-` `region-starport` Provides access to the Amazon S3 bucket

`-layer-bucket/*` containing the layers for each Docker image.

Represents the Region identifier for an AWS
Region supported by Amazon ECR, such as
```
                       us-east-2 for the US East (Ohio) Region.

```
**Example**

The following example illustrates how to provide access to the Amazon S3 buckets required for
Amazon ECR operations.
```
 {
  "Statement": [
   {
    "Sid": "Access-to-specific-bucket-only",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": [
     "s3:GetObject"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::prod-region-starport-layer-bucket/*"]
   }
  ]
 }

##### Create the CloudWatch Logs endpoint

```
Amazon ECS tasks using the Fargate launch type that use a VPC without an internet gateway that

also use the awslogs log driver to send log information to CloudWatch Logs require that you

create the com.amazonaws.region.logs interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. For more
[information, see Using CloudWatch Logs with interface VPC endpoints in the Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch-logs-and-interface-VPC.html)
_Logs User Guide._

Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) API Version 2015-09-21 218

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|arn:aws:s3:::prod- region-starport -layer-bucket/*|Provides access to the Amazon S3 bucket containing the layers for each Docker image. Represents the Region identifier for an AWS Region supported by Amazon ECR, such as us-east-2 for the US East (Ohio) Region.|


-----

##### Create an endpoint policy for your Amazon ECR VPC endpoints

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when you create
or modify the endpoint. If you don't attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches
a default policy for you that allows full access to the service. An endpoint policy doesn't override
or replace user policies or service-specific policies. It's a separate policy for controlling access from
the endpoint to the specified service. Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format. For more
[information, see Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html)

We recommend creating a single IAM resource policy and attaching it to both of the Amazon ECR
VPC endpoints.

The following is an example of an endpoint policy for Amazon ECR. This policy enables a specific
IAM role to pull images from Amazon ECR.
```
 {
 "Statement": [{
  "Sid": "AllowPull",
  "Principal": {
  "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/role_name"
  },
  "Action": [
  "ecr:BatchGetImage",
  "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
           "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
  ],
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Resource": "*"
 }]
 }

```
The following endpoint policy example prevents a specified repository from being deleted.
```
 {
 "Statement": [{
  "Sid": "AllowAll",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "*",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Resource": "*"
  },

```
Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) API Version 2015-09-21 219

  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:region:1234567890:repository/repository_name"
 }
 ]
}

```

The following endpoint policy example combines the two previous examples into a single policy.
```
 {
 "Statement": [{
  "Sid": "AllowAll",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "*",
  "Resource": "*"

##### Shared subnets

You can't create, describe, modify, or delete VPC endpoints in subnets that are shared with you.
However, you can use the VPC endpoints in subnets that are shared with you.

### Cross-service confused deputy prevention

The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesn't have permission to
perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action. In AWS, cross-service
impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem. Cross-service impersonation can occur
when one service (the calling service) calls another service (the called service). The calling service
can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customer's resources in a way it should
not otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS provides tools that help you protect

your data for all services with service principals that have been given access to resources in your
account.

[We recommend using the aws:SourceArn or aws:SourceAccount global condition context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn)
in resource policies to limit the permissions that Amazon ECR gives another service to the resource.

Use aws:SourceArn if you want only one resource to be associated with the cross-service access.

Use aws:SourceAccount if you want to allow any resource in that account to be associated with
the cross-service use.

The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the
```
aws:SourceArn global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource. If you don't know

```
the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple resources, use the aws:SourceArn

Cross-service confused deputy prevention API Version 2015-09-21 221


-----

global context condition key with wildcard characters (*) for the unknown portions of the ARN. For

example, arn:aws:servicename:region:123456789012:*.

If the aws:SourceArn value does not contain the account ID, such as an Amazon S3 bucket ARN,
you must use both global condition context keys to limit permissions.

The value of aws:SourceArn must be ResourceDescription.

The following example shows how you can use the aws:SourceArn and aws:SourceAccount
global condition context keys in an Amazon ECR repository policy to allow AWS CodeBuild access
to the Amazon ECR API actions necessary for integration with that service while also preventing
the confused deputy problem.

## Amazon ECR monitoring

You can monitor your Amazon ECR API usage with Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and
processes raw data from Amazon ECR into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics
are recorded for a period of two weeks so that you can access historical information and gain
perspective on your API usage. Amazon ECR metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch in
[one-minute periods. For more information about CloudWatch, see the Amazon CloudWatch User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)
[Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)

Amazon ECR provides metrics based on your API usage for authorization, image push, and image
pull actions.

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of
Amazon ECR and your AWS solutions. We recommend that you collect monitoring data from the

resources that make up your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure
if one occurs. Before you start monitoring Amazon ECR, however, you should create a monitoring
plan that includes answers to the following questions:

- What are your monitoring goals?

- What resources will you monitor?

- How often will you monitor these resources?

- What monitoring tools will you use?

- Who will perform the monitoring tasks?

- Who should be notified when something goes wrong?

The next step is to establish a baseline for normal Amazon ECR performance in your environment
by measuring performance at various times and under different load conditions. As you monitor
Amazon ECR, store historical monitoring data so that you can compare it with new performance
data, identify normal performance patterns and performance anomalies, and devise methods to
address issues.

### Visualizing your service quotas and setting alarms

You can use the CloudWatch console to visualize your service quotas and see how your current
usage compares to service quotas. You can also set alarms so that you will be notified when you
approach a quota.

**To visualize a service quota and optionally set an alarm**

1. [Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)

2. In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.

3. On the All metrics tab, choose Usage, then choose By AWS Resource.

The list of service quota usage metrics appears.

4. Select the check box next to one of the metrics.

The graph displays your current usage of that AWS resource.

5. To add your service quota to the graph, do the following:

a. Choose the Graphed metrics tab.

b. Choose Math expression, Start with an empty expression. Then in the new row, under

**Details, enter SERVICE_QUOTA(m1).**

A new line is added to the graph, displaying the service quota for the resource represented
in the metric.

6. To see your current usage as a percentage of the quota, add a new expression or

change the current SERVICE_QUOTA expression. For the new expression, use m1/60/
```
  SERVICE_QUOTA(m1)*100.

```
7. (Optional) To set an alarm that notifies you if you approach the service quota, do the
following:

a. On the m1/60/SERVICE_QUOTA(m1)*100 row, under Actions, choose the alarm icon. It
looks like a bell.

Visualizing Your Service Quotas and Setting Alarms API Version 2015-09-21 224


-----

The alarm creation page appears.

b. Under Conditions, ensure that Threshold type is Static and Whenever Expression1 is is

set to Greater. Under than, enter 80. This creates an alarm that goes into ALARM state
when your usage exceeds 80 percent of the quota.

c. Choose Next.

d. On the next page, select an Amazon SNS topic or create a new one. This topic is notified
when the alarm goes to ALARM state. Then choose Next.

e. On the next page, enter a name and description for the alarm, and then choose Next.

f. Choose Create alarm.

### Amazon ECR usage metrics

You can use CloudWatch usage metrics to provide visibility into your account's usage of resources.
Use these metrics to visualize your current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards.

Amazon ECR usage metrics correspond to AWS service quotas. You can configure alarms that alert
you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information about Amazon ECR service
quotas, see Amazon ECR service quotas.

Amazon ECR publishes the following metrics in the AWS/Usage namespace.

**Metric** **Description**

`CallCount` The number of API action calls from your account. The
resources are defined by the dimensions associated with the
metric.

The most useful statistic for this metric is SUM, which represent
s the sum of the values from all contributors during the period
defined.

The following dimensions are used to refine the usage metrics that are published by Amazon ECR.

Usage Metrics API Version 2015-09-21 225

|Metric|Description|
|---|---|
|CallCount|The number of API action calls from your account. The resources are defined by the dimensions associated with the metric. The most useful statistic for this metric is SUM, which represent s the sum of the values from all contributors during the period defined.|


-----

|Dimension|Description|
|---|---|
|Service|The name of the AWS service containing the resource. For Amazon ECR usage metrics, the value for this dimension is ECR.|
|Type|The type of entity that is being reported. Currently, the only valid value for Amazon ECR usage metrics is API.|
|Resource|The type of resource that is running. Currently, Amazon ECR returns information on your API usage for the following API actions. â¢ GetAuthorizationToken â¢ BatchCheckLayerAvailability â¢ InitiateLayerUpload â¢ UploadLayerPart â¢ CompleteLayerUpload â¢ PutImage â¢ BatchGetImage â¢ GetDownloadUrlForLayer|
|Class|The class of resource being tracked. Currently, Amazon ECR does not use the class dimension.|


### Amazon ECR usage reports

AWS provides a free reporting tool called Cost Explorer that enables you to analyze the cost and
usage of your Amazon ECR resources.

Use Cost Explorer to view charts of your usage and costs. You can view data from the previous 13
months and forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next three months. You can use Cost
Explorer to see patterns in how much you spend on AWS resources over time, identify areas that
need further inquiry, and see trends that you can use to understand your costs. You also can specify
time ranges for the data and view time data by day or by month.

Usage Reports API Version 2015-09-21 226


-----

The metering data in your Cost and Usage Reports shows usage across all of your Amazon ECR
repositories. For more information, see Tagging your resources for billing.

provides a fine-grained and customizable display of your resources. For more information, see the
[Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)

### Amazon ECR events and EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge enables you to automate your AWS services and to respond automatically to
system events such as application availability issues or resource changes. Events from AWS services
are delivered to EventBridge in near real time. You can write simple rules to indicate which events
are of interest to you and include automated actions to take when an event matches a rule. The
actions that can be automatically triggered include the following:

- Adding events to log groups in CloudWatch Logs

- Invoking an AWS Lambda function

- Invoking Amazon EC2 Run Command

- Relaying the event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

- Activating an AWS Step Functions state machine

- Notifying an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon SQS queue

### Logging Amazon ECR actions with AWS CloudTrail

Amazon ECR is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken
by a user, a role, or an AWS service in Amazon ECR. CloudTrail captures the following Amazon ECR
actions as events:

- All API calls, including calls from the Amazon ECR console

- All actions taken due to the encryption settings on your repositories

- All actions taken due to lifecycle policy rules, including both successful and unsuccessful actions

**Important**

Due to the size limitations of individual CloudTrail events, for lifecycle policy actions
where 10 or more images are expired Amazon ECR sends multiple events to CloudTrail.
Additionally, Amazon ECR includes a maximum of 100 tags per image.

Logging Actions with AWS CloudTrail API Version 2015-09-21 233


-----

When a trail is created, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3
bucket, including events for Amazon ECR. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most
recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using this information, you can determine
the request that was made to Amazon ECR, the originating IP address, who made the request,
when it was made, and additional details.

[For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)

#### Amazon ECR information in CloudTrail

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in
Amazon ECR, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in
**Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more**
[information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html)

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Amazon ECR, create
a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. When you create
a trail in the console, you can apply the trail to a single Region or to all Regions. The trail logs
events in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify.
Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to analyze and act upon the event data
collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see:

[â¢ Creating a trail for your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.html)

[All Amazon ECR API actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the Amazon Elastic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/)
[Container Registry API Reference. When you perform common tasks, sections are generated in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/)
the CloudTrail log files for each API action that is part of that task. For example, when you create

a repository, GetAuthorizationToken, CreateRepository and SetRepositoryPolicy
sections are generated in the CloudTrail log files. When you push an image to a repository,
```
InitiateLayerUpload, UploadLayerPart, CompleteLayerUpload, and PutImage sections

```
are generated. When you pull an image, GetDownloadUrlForLayer and BatchGetImage
sections are generated. When OCI clients that support the OCI 1.1 specification fetch the list of

referrers, or reference artifacts, for an image using the Referrers API, a ListImageReferrers

CloudTrail event is emitted. For examples of these common tasks, see CloudTrail log entry
examples.

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The identity
information helps you determine the following:

- Whether the request was made with root or user credentials

- Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user

- Whether the request was made by another AWS service

[For more information, see the CloudTrail userIdentity Element.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html)

#### Understanding Amazon ECR log file entries

A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that
you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single
request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of
the action, request parameters, and other information. CloudTrail log files are not an ordered stack
trace of the public API calls, so they do not appear in any specific order.

##### CloudTrail log entry examples

The following are CloudTrail log entry examples for a few common Amazon ECR tasks.

These examples have been formatted for improved readability. In a CloudTrail log file, all entries
and events are concatenated into a single line. In addition, this example has been limited to a
single Amazon ECR entry. In a real CloudTrail log file, you see entries and events from multiple
AWS services.

**Important**

The sourceIPAddress is the IP address that the request was made from. For actions that
originate from the service console, the address reported is for your underlying resource,
not the console web server. For services in AWS, only the DNS name is displayed. We still
evaluate the auth with the client source IP even if it's redacted to AWS service DNS name.

**Example: AWS KMS CreateGrant API action when creating an Amazon ECR repository**

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry that demonstrates the AWS KMS CreateGrant
action when creating an Amazon ECR repository with KMS encryption enabled. For each repository
that is created with KMS encryption is enabled, you should see two CreateGrant log entries in
CloudTrail.

**Example: Image lifecycle policy action**

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry that demonstrates when an image
is expired due to a lifecycle policy rule. This event type can be located by filtering for
```
PolicyExecutionEvent for the event name field.

```
Understanding Amazon ECR log file entries API Version 2015-09-21 243


-----

**Important**

Due to the size limitations of individual CloudTrail events, for lifecycle policy actions
where 10 or more images are expired Amazon ECR sends multiple events to CloudTrail.
Additionally, Amazon ECR includes a maximum of 100 tags per image.

## Code examples for Amazon ECR using AWS SDKs

The following code examples show how to use Amazon ECR with an AWS software development kit
(SDK).

_Basics are code examples that show you how to perform the essential operations within a service._

_Actions are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you_
how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

For a complete list of AWS SDK developer guides and code examples, see Using Amazon ECR with
an AWS SDK. This topic also includes information about getting started and details about previous
SDK versions.

The Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container
 registry
service provided by AWS. It allows developers and organizations to securely
store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.
ECR provides a simple and scalable way to manage container images throughout
 their lifecycle,
from building and testing to production deployment.
The `ECRWrapper' class is a wrapper for the Boto3 'ecr' client. The 'ecr' client
 provides a set of methods to
programmatically interact with the Amazon ECR service. This allows developers to
automate the storage, retrieval, and management of container images as part of
 their application
deployment pipelines. With ECR, teams can focus on building and deploying their
applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure required
 to
host and manage a container registry.

**AWS CLI**

**To create a lifecycle policy**

The following put-lifecycle-policy example creates a lifecycle policy for the specified
repository in the default registry for an account.
```
    aws ecr put-lifecycle-policy \
      --repository-name "project-a/amazon-ecs-sample" \
      --lifecycle-policy-text "file://policy.json"

```
Contents of policy.json:
```
    {
      "rules": [
        {

### Managing your Amazon ECR service quotas in the AWS Management Console

Amazon ECR has integrated with Service Quotas, an AWS service that enables you to view and
[manage your quotas from a central location. For more information, see What Is Service Quotas? in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html)
the Service Quotas User Guide.

Service Quotas makes it easy to look up the value of all Amazon ECR service quotas.

**To view Amazon ECR service quotas (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)

2. In the navigation pane, choose AWS services.

3. From the AWS services list, search for and select Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon
**ECR).**

In the Service quotas list, you can see the service quota name, applied value (if it is available),
AWS default quota, and whether the quota value is adjustable.

#### Creating a CloudWatch alarm to monitor API usage metrics

Amazon ECR provides CloudWatch usage metrics that correspond to the AWS service quotas for
each of the APIs involved with the registry authentication, image push, and image pull actions.
In the Service Quotas console, you can visualize your usage on a graph and configure alarms that
alert you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information, see Amazon ECR
usage metrics.

Use the following steps to create a CloudWatch alarm based on one of the Amazon ECR API usage
metrics.

**To create an alarm based on your Amazon ECR usage quotas (AWS Management Console)**

1. [Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)

2. In the navigation pane, choose AWS services.

3. From the AWS services list, search for and select Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon
**ECR).**

4. In the Service quotas list, select the Amazon ECR usage quota you want to create an alarm for.

5. In the Amazon CloudWatch Events alarms section, choose Create.

6. For Alarm threshold, choose the percentage of your applied quota value that you want to set
as the alarm value.

7. For Alarm name, enter a name for the alarm and then choose Create.

## Amazon ECR troubleshooting

This chapter helps you find diagnostic information for Amazon ECR, and provides troubleshooting
steps for common issues and error messages.

**Topics**

- Troubleshooting Docker commands and issues when using Amazon ECR

- Troubleshooting Amazon ECR error messages

### Troubleshooting Docker commands and issues when using Amazon ECR

In some cases, running a Docker command against Amazon ECR might result in an error message.
Some common error messages and potential solutions are explained below.

**Topics**

- Docker logs do not contain expected error messages

- Error: "Filesystem Verification Failed" or "404: Image Not Found" when pulling an image from an

Amazon ECR repository

- Error: "Filesystem Layer Verification Failed" when pulling images from Amazon ECR

- HTTP 403 Errors or "no basic auth credentials" error when pushing to repository

#### Docker logs do not contain expected error messages

To begin debugging any Docker-related issue, start by turning on Docker debugging output on the
Docker daemon running on your host instances. If you are using images pulled from Amazon ECR
[on Amazon ECS container instances, see Configuring verbose output from the Docker daemon in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-debug-mode.html)
the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

Troubleshooting Docker API Version 2015-09-21 373


-----

#### Error: "Filesystem Verification Failed" or "404: Image Not Found" when pulling an image from an Amazon ECR repository

You may receive the error Filesystem verification failed when using the docker pull
command to pull an image from an Amazon ECR repository with Docker 1.9 or above. You may

receive the error 404: Image not found when you are using Docker versions before 1.9.

Some possible reasons and their explanations are given below.

The local disk is full

If the local disk on which you're running docker pull is full, then the SHA-1 hash calculated on
the local file may be different than the one calculated by Amazon ECR. Check that your local
disk has enough remaining free space to store the Docker image you are pulling. You can also
delete old images to make room for new ones. Use the docker images command to see a list of
all locally downloaded Docker images, along with their sizes.

Client cannot connect to the remote repository due to network error

Calls to an Amazon ECR repository require a functioning connection to the internet. Verify
your network settings, and verify that other tools and applications can access resources on the
internet. If you are running docker pull on an Amazon EC2 instance in a private subnet, verify
that the subnet has a route to the internet. Use a network address translation (NAT) server or a
managed NAT gateway.

Currently, calls to an Amazon ECR repository also require network access through your
corporate firewall to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). If your organization uses

firewall software or a NAT device that allows service endpoints, ensure that the Amazon S3
service endpoints for your current Region are allowed.

If you are using Docker behind an HTTP proxy, you can configure Docker with the appropriate
[proxy settings. For more information, see HTTP proxy in the Docker documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/#/http-proxy)

#### Error: "Filesystem Layer Verification Failed" when pulling images from Amazon ECR

You may receive the error image image-name not found when pulling images using the docker
**pull command. If you inspect the Docker logs, you may see an error like the following:**


Error: "Filesystem Verification Failed" or "404: Image Not Found" when pulling an image from an

C i


API Version 2015-09-21 374


-----

```
filesystem layer verification failed for digest sha256:2b96f...

```

This error indicates that one or more of the layers for your image has failed to download. Some
possible reasons and their explanations are given below.

You are using an older version of Docker

This error can occur in a small percentage of cases when using a Docker version less than 1.10.
Upgrade your Docker client to 1.10 or greater.

Your client has encountered a network or disk error

A full disk or a network issue may prevent one or more layers from downloading, as

discussed earlier about the Filesystem verification failed message. Follow the
recommendations above to ensure that your filesystem is not full, and that you have enabled
access to Amazon S3 from within your network.

#### HTTP 403 Errors or "no basic auth credentials" error when pushing to repository

There are times when you may receive an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) error, or the error message
```
no basic auth credentials from the docker push or docker pull commands, even if you

```
have successfully authenticated to Docker using the aws ecr get-login-password command. The
following are some known causes of this issue:

You have authenticated to a different region

Authentication requests are tied to specific regions, and cannot be used across regions. For
example, if you obtain an authorization token from US West (Oregon), you cannot use it to
authenticate against your repositories in US East (N. Virginia). To resolve the issue, ensure that
you have retrieved an authentication token from the same Region your repository exists in. For
more information, see the section called âRegistry authenticationâ.

You have authenticated to push to a repository you don't have permissions for

You do not have the necessary permissions to push to the repository. For more information, see
Private repository policies in Amazon ECR.

HTTP 403 Errors or "no basic auth credentials" error when pushing to repository API Version 2015-09-21 375


-----

Your token has expired

The default authorization token expiration period for tokens obtained using the
```
  GetAuthorizationToken operation is 12 hours.

```
Bug in wincred credential manager

Some versions of Docker for Windows use a credential manager called wincred, which does
not properly handle the Docker login command produced by aws ecr get-login-password
[(for more information, see https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/22910). You can run](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/22910)
the Docker login command that is output, but when you try to push or pull images, those

commands fail. You can work around this bug by removing the https:// scheme from
the registry argument in the Docker login command that is output from aws ecr get-login**password. An example Docker login command without the HTTPS scheme is shown below.**
```
   docker login -u AWS -p <password> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

### Troubleshooting Amazon ECR error messages

```
In some cases, an API call that you have initiated through the Amazon ECR console or the AWS CLI
exits with an error message. Some common error messages and potential solutions are explained
below.

#### HTTP 429: Too Many Requests or ThrottleException

You may receive a 429: Too Many Requests error or a ThrottleException error from one
or more Amazon ECR actions or API calls. This indicates that you are calling a single endpoint
in Amazon ECR repeatedly over a short interval, and that your requests are getting throttled.
Throttling occurs when calls to a single endpoint from a single user exceed a certain threshold over
a period of time.

Each API operations in Amazon ECR has a rate throttles associated with it. For example, the

[throttle for the GetAuthorizationToken action is 20 transaction per second (TPS), with up to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_GetAuthorizationToken.html)
a 200 TPS burst allowed. In each region, each account receives a bucket that can store up to 200
```
GetAuthorizationToken credits. These credits are replenished at a rate of 20 per second. If

```
your bucket has 200 credits, you could achieve 200 GetAuthorizationToken API transactions
per second for one second, and then sustain 20 transactions per second indefinitely. For more
information on the rate limits for Amazon ECR APIs, see Amazon ECR service quotas.

Troubleshooting Amazon ECR error messages API Version 2015-09-21 376


-----

To handle throttling errors, implement a retry function with incremental backoff into your code.
[For more information, see Retry behavior in the AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide. Another](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html)
option is to request a rate limit increase, which you can do using the Service Quotas console.
For more information, see Managing your Amazon ECR service quotas in the AWS Management

#### HTTP 403: "User [arn] is not authorized to perform [operation]"

You may receive the following error when attempting to perform an action with Amazon ECR:
```
 $ aws ecr get-login-password
 A client error (AccessDeniedException) occurred when calling the GetAuthorizationToken
 operation: 
   User: arn:aws:iam::account-number:user/username is not authorized to perform: 
   ecr:GetAuthorizationToken on resource: *

```
This indicates that your user does not have permissions granted to use Amazon ECR, or that those
permissions are not set up correctly. In particular, if you are performing actions against an Amazon
ECR repository, verify that the user has been granted permissions to access that repository. For
more information about creating and verifying permissions for Amazon ECR, see Identity and
Access Management for Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

#### HTTP 404: "Repository Does Not Exist" error

If you specify a Docker Hub repository that does not currently exist, Docker Hub creates it
automatically. With Amazon ECR, new repositories must be explicitly created before they can
be used. This prevents new repositories from being created accidentally (for example, due to
typos), and it also ensures that an appropriate security access policy is explicitly assigned to any
new repositories. For more information about creating repositories, see Amazon ECR private
repositories.

#### Error: Cannot perform an interactive login from a non TTY device

If you receive the error Cannot perform an interactive login from a non TTY device,
the following troubleshooting steps should help.

- Verify that you're using AWS CLI version 2 and that you don't have a conflicting version of AWS

[CLI version 1 on your system. For more information, see Installing or updating the latest version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
[of the AWS CLI.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

HTTP 403: "User [arn] is not authorized to perform [operation]" API Version 2015-09-21 377

- Verify that you've configured your AWS CLI with valid credentials. For more information, see

[Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

- Verify that the syntax of your AWS CLI command is correct.

## Using Podman with Amazon ECR

Using Podman with Amazon ECR enables organizations to leverage the security and simplicity of
Podman while benefiting from the scalability and reliability of Amazon ECR for container image
management. By following the outlined steps and commands, developers and administrators
can streamline their container workflows, enhance security, and optimize resource utilization. As
containerization continues to gain momentum, using Podman and Amazon ECR provides a robust
and flexible solution for managing and deploying containerized applications.

### Using Podman to authenticate with Amazon ECR

Before interacting with Amazon ECR using Podman, authentication is required. This can

be achieved by running the `aws ecr get-login-password` command to retrieve an

authentication token, and then using that token with the `podman login` command to
authenticate with Amazon ECR.
```
 aws ecr get-login-password --region region | podman login --username AWS --password stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com

### Pulling images from Amazon ECR with Podman

```
After successful authentication, container images can be pulled from Amazon ECR using the
```
`podman pull` command with the full Amazon ECR repository URI.
 podman pull aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/repository_name:tag

### Running containers for Amazon ECR with Podman

```
Once the desired image has been pulled, a container can be instantiated using the `podman run`
command.
```
 podman run -d aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/repository_name:tag

```

### Pushing images to Amazon ECR with Podman

To push a local image to Amazon ECR, the image must first be tagged with the Amazon ECR

repository URI using `podman tag`, and then the `podman push` command can be used to
upload the image to Amazon ECR.
```
 podman
 tag local_image:tag aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/repository_name:tag
 podman push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/repository_name:tag

```
