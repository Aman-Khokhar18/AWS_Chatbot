## What Is Amazon CloudSearch?

**Important**

Amazon CloudSearch is no longer available to new customers. Existing customers of
[Amazon CloudSearch can continue to use the service as usual. Learn more.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/how-to-migrate-from-aws-cloud9-to-aws-ide-toolkits-or-aws-cloudshell/)

Amazon CloudSearch is a fully managed service in the cloud that makes it easy to set up, manage,
and scale a search solution for your website or application.

With Amazon CloudSearch you can search large collections of data such as web pages, document
files, forum posts, or product information. You can quickly add search capabilities without having

to become a search expert or worry about hardware provisioning, setup, and maintenance. As your
volume of data and traffic fluctuates, Amazon CloudSearch scales to meet your needs.

**Note**

This document describes the Amazon CloudSearch 2013-01-01 API. If you have
2011-02-01 search domains and need to reference the old documentation, you can
[download a PDF of the 2011-02-01 Developer Guide.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsdocs/cloudsearch/2011-02-01/cloudsearch-dg-2011-02-01.pdf)

You can use Amazon CloudSearch to index and search both structured data and plain text. Amazon
CloudSearch features:

- Full text search with language-specific text processing

- Boolean search

- Prefix searches

- Range searches

- Term boosting

- Faceting

- Highlighting

- Autocomplete suggestions

API Version 2013-01-01 1


-----

You can get search results in JSON or XML, sort and filter results based on field values, and sort
results alphabetically, numerically, or according to custom expressions.

To build a search solution with Amazon CloudSearch, you take the following steps:

- Create and configure a search domain. A search domain includes your searchable data and the

search instances that handle your search requests. If you have multiple collections of data that
you want to make searchable, you can create multiple search domains.

- Upload the data you want to search to your domain. Amazon CloudSearch indexes your data

and deploys the search index to one or more search instances.

- Search your domain. You send a search request to your domain's search endpoint as an HTTP/

HTTPS GET request.

### Are You New to Amazon CloudSearch?

For a high-level overview of Amazon CloudSearch, service highlights, and pricing information, see
[the Amazon CloudSearch detail page. If you are ready to start using Amazon CloudSearch, you](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/)
should begin with Getting Started with Amazon CloudSearch.

You can interact with Amazon CloudSearch through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, or
AWS CLI. While you can also submit API requests directly to Amazon CloudSearch, the SDKs and
AWS CLI automatically sign your requests as needed and provide centralized tools for interacting
with Amazon CloudSearch domains in conjunction with other AWS services. For information about
[the AWS SDKs, see Tools for Amazon Web Services. For information about installing and using the](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/)
[AWS CLI, see the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

For more information about configuring and managing your search domains, getting your data into
Amazon CloudSearch, submitting search requests, and processing the responses, see:

### How Search Works

The collection of data that you want to search (sometimes referred to as your corpus) can consist
of unstructured full-text documents, semi-structured documents such as those formatted in markup languages like XML, or structured data that conforms to a strict data model. Each item that you
want to be able to search (such as a forum post or web page) is represented as a document. Every
document has a unique ID and one or more fields that contain the data that you want to search
and include in results.

To make your data searchable, you represent it as a batch of documents in either JSON or XML and
upload the batch to your search domain. Amazon CloudSearch then generates a search index from
your document data according to your domain's configuration options. You submit queries against
this index to find the documents that meet specific search criteria.

As your data changes, you submit updates to add, change, or delete documents from your index.
Updates are applied continuously in the order they are received.

For information about how to format your data, see Preparing Your Data.

#### Indexing in Amazon CloudSearch

To build a search index from your data, Amazon CloudSearch needs the following information:

- Which document fields do you want to search?

- Which document field values do you want to retrieve with the search results?

- Which document fields represent categories that you want to use to refine and filter search

results?

- How should the text within a particular field be processed?

How Search Works API Version 2013-01-01 3


-----

You define this metadata in your domain configuration by configuring indexing options. You use
indexing options to specify the fields included in the search index and control how you can use
those fields.

You must configure a corresponding index field for each document field that occurs in your dataâ
there's a one-to-one mapping between document fields and the fields in your Amazon CloudSearch
index. In addition to the index field name, you specify the following:

- The index field type

- Whether the field is searchable (text and text-array fields are always searchable)

- Whether the field can be used as a category (facet)

- Whether the field value can be returned with the search results

- Whether the field can be used to sort the results

- Whether highlights can be returned for the field

- A default value to use if no value is specified in the document data.

For information about how to configure index fields for Amazon CloudSearch, see configure
indexing options.

#### Facets in Amazon CloudSearch

A facet is an index field that represents a category that you want to use to refine and filter
search results. When you submit search requests to Amazon CloudSearch, you can request facet
information to find out how many hits share the same value in a facet. You can display this
information along with the search results and use it to enable users to interactively refine their
searches. (This is often referred to as faceted navigation or faceted search.)

A facet can be any date, literal, or numeric field that has faceting enabled in your domain
configuration. For each facet, Amazon CloudSearch calculates the number of hits that share the
same value. You can define buckets to calculate facet counts for particular subsets of the facet
values. Only buckets that have matches are included in the facet results.

For information about configuring facets, see configure indexing options. For information about
using facet information to support faceted navigation, see Getting and Using Facet Information in
Amazon CloudSearch.

Facets API Version 2013-01-01 4


-----

#### Text Processing in Amazon CloudSearch

During indexing, Amazon CloudSearch processes the contents of text and text-array fields

according to the language-specific analysis scheme configured for the field. An analysis scheme

controls how the text is normalized, tokenized, and stemmed, and specifies any stopwords or
synonyms to take into account during indexing. Amazon CloudSearch provides default analysis
schemes for each supported language. For information about configuring custom analysis schemes,
see Configuring Analysis Schemes. For information about how Amazon CloudSearch normalizes
and tokenizes text and applies configured text options when indexing text fields and processing
search requests, see Text Processing in Amazon CloudSearch.

#### Sorting Results in Amazon CloudSearch

You can customize how search results are ranked by defining expressions that calculate custom
values for every document that matches your search criteria. For example, you might define

an expression that takes into account the value in a document's popularity field as well as
the default relevance score calculated by Amazon CloudSearch Expressions are simply numeric

expressions that use standard numeric operators and functions. Expressions can reference int and
```
double fields, other expressions, a document's relevance score (_score), as well as the epoch time

```
(_time). When you submit search requests, you specify the expression(s) you want to use to sort the
search results. You can also reference expressions within your search criteria.

A document's relevance _score indicates how relevant a particular search hit is to the search
request. To calculate the relevance score, Amazon CloudSearch takes into account how many times
the search terms appear in a document relative to the other documents in the index.

For information about how to configure expressions for your domain, see Configuring Expressions.

#### Search Requests in Amazon CloudSearch

You submit search requests to your domain's search endpoint as HTTP/HTTPS GET requests. You
can specify a variety of options to constrain your search, request facet information, control ranking,
and specify what you want to be returned in the results. You can get search results in either JSON
or XML. By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns results in JSON.

When you submit a search request, Amazon CloudSearch performs text processing on the search
string. The search string is processed to:

- Convert all characters to lowercase

Text Processing API Version 2013-01-01 5


-----

- Split the string into separate terms on whitespace and punctuation boundaries

- Remove terms that are on the stopword list for the field being searched.

- Map stems and synonyms according to the stemming and synonym options configured for the

field being searched.

After this preprocessing is complete, Amazon CloudSearch looks up the search terms in the index
and identifies all of the documents that match the request. To generate a response, Amazon
CloudSearch processes this list of search hits to filter and sort the matching documents and
compute facets. Amazon CloudSearch then returns the response in JSON or XML.

By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns search results ranked according to the hits' relevance
_scores. Alternatively, your request can specify the index field or expression that you want to use to
sort the hits. For example, you might want to sort hits by an index field that contains the price or
an expression that calculates popularity.

For more information about searching, ranking, and paginating results, see Searching Your Data
with Amazon CloudSearch.

### Automatic Scaling in Amazon CloudSearch

A search domain has one or more search instances, each with a finite amount of RAM and CPU
resources for indexing data and processing requests. How many search instances a domain needs
depends on the documents in your collection and the volume and complexity of your search
requests.

Amazon CloudSearch can determine the size and number of search instances required to deliver
low latency, high throughput search performance. When you upload your data and configure your
index, Amazon CloudSearch builds an index and picks the appropriate initial search instance type.
As you use your search domain, Amazon CloudSearch can scale to accommodate the amount of
data uploaded to the domain and the volume and complexity of search requests.

When you create a search domain, a single instance is deployed for the domain. As the following
illustration shows, you always have at least one instance for your domain. Amazon CloudSearch
automatically scales the domain by adding instances as the volume of data or traffic increases.

Automatic Scaling API Version 2013-01-01 6


-----

#### Scaling for Data

When the amount of data you add to your domain exceeds the capacity of the initial search
instance type, Amazon CloudSearch scales your search domain to a larger search instance type.
After a domain exceeds the capacity of the largest search instance type, Amazon CloudSearch
partitions the search index across multiple search instances. (The number of search instances
required to hold the index partitions is sometimes referred to as the domain's width.)

When the volume of data in your domain shrinks, Amazon CloudSearch scales down your domain
to fewer search instances or a smaller search instance type to minimize costs.

Scaling for Data API Version 2013-01-01 7


-----

**Note**

If your domain has scaled up to accommodate your index size and you delete a large
number of documents, the domain scales down the next time the full index is rebuilt.
Although the index is automatically rebuilt periodically, to scale down as quickly as possible
you can explicitly run indexing when you are done deleting documents.


#### Scaling for Traffic

As your search request volume or complexity increases, it takes more processing power to handle
the load. A high volume of document uploads also increases the load on a domain's search
instances. When a search instance nears its maximum load, Amazon CloudSearch deploys a
duplicate search instance to provide additional processing power. (The number of duplicate search
instances is sometimes referred to as the domain's depth.)

When traffic drops, Amazon CloudSearch removes search instances to minimize costs. For example,
a new domain might scale up to handle the initial influx of documents, and scale back down after
you have finished uploading your data and are only submitting updates.

If your domain experiences a sudden surge in traffic, Amazon CloudSearch deploys additional
search instances. It takes a few minutes to set up the new instances, however, so you might see an
increase in 5xx errors until the new instances can start processing requests. For more information
about handling 5xx errors, see Handling Errors.

Keep in mind that the type and complexity of your search requests affect overall search
performance and in some cases increase the number of search instances required to operate your
domain. Submitting a high volume of small or single-document batches can affect your search
domain's performance. For more information, see Tuning Search Request Performance in Amazon
CloudSearch.

### Accessing Amazon CloudSearch

You can access Amazon CloudSearch through the Amazon CloudSearch console, the AWS SDKs, or
the AWS CLI.

[â¢ The Amazon CloudSearch console enables you to easily create, configure, and monitor your](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home?region=us-west-2)

search domains, upload documents, and run test searches. Using the console is the easiest way

Scaling for Traffic API Version 2013-01-01 8


-----

to get started with Amazon CloudSearch and provides a central command center for the ongoing
management of your search domains.

[â¢ The AWS SDKs support all of the Amazon CloudSearch API operations, making it easy to manage](http://aws.amazon.com/code)

and interact with your search domains using your preferred technology. The SDKs automatically
sign requests as needed using your AWS credentials.

[â¢ The AWS CLI wraps all of the Amazon CloudSearch API operations to provide a simple way to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

create and configure search domains, upload the data you want to search, and submit search
requests. The AWS CLI automatically signs requests as needed using your AWS credentials.

#### Regions and Endpoints for Amazon CloudSearch

Amazon CloudSearch provides regional endpoints for accessing the configuration service and
domain-specific endpoints for accessing the search and document services.

You use the configuration service to create and manage your search domains. The region-specific

configuration service endpoints are of the form: cloudsearch.region.amazonaws.com. For

example, cloudsearch.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For a current list of supported regions,
[see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloudsearch_region)

To access the Amazon CloudSearch search and document services, you use separate domainspecific endpoints:

- http://doc-domainname-domainid.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.comâa

domain's document service endpoint is used to upload documents

- http://search-domainname-domainid.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.comâa

domain's search endpoint is used to submit search requests

#### Signing Amazon CloudSearch Requests

If you're using a language for which AWS provides an SDK, we recommend that you use the SDK
to submit Amazon CloudSearch requests. All of the AWS SDKs greatly simplify the process of
signing requests and save you a significant amount of time when compared to using the Amazon
CloudSearch APIs directly. The SDKs integrate easily with your development environment and
provide easy access to related commands. You can also use the Amazon CloudSearch console and
AWS CLI to submit signed requests with no additional effort.

Regions and Endpoints API Version 2013-01-01 9


-----

If you choose to call the Amazon CloudSearch APIs directly, you must sign your own requests.
Configuration service requests must always be signed. Upload, search, and suggest requests
must be signed, unless you configure anonymous access for those services. To sign a request,
you calculate a digital signature using a cryptographic hash function, which returns a hash
value based on the input. The input includes the text of your request and your secret access
key. The hash function returns a hash value that you include in the request as your signature.
The signature is part of the Authorization header of your request. After receiving your request,
Amazon CloudSearch recalculates the signature using the same hash function and input that you
used to sign the request. If the resulting signature matches the signature in the request, Amazon
CloudSearch processes the request. Otherwise, the request is rejected.

Amazon CloudSearch supports authentication using AWS Signature Version 4. For more
[information, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)

## Getting Started with Amazon CloudSearch

To start searching your data with Amazon CloudSearch, you simply take the following steps:

- Create and configure a search domain

- Upload and index the data you want to search

- Send search requests to your domain

This tutorial shows you how to get up and running using the AWS Management Console for
Amazon CloudSearch. To make it even easier to get started, we've generated a sample data set
of 5,000 popular movie titles that you can download and examine, upload to your own search
domain, and submit search queries against to see how Amazon CloudSearch works.

Using the AWS Management Console and the sample movie data, you'll have your own search
domain up and running in about half an hour.

To begin, Get Signed Up.

- Step 3: Search Your Amazon CloudSearch Domain

- Step 4: Delete Your Amazon CloudSearch Movies Domain

### Before You Begin with Amazon CloudSearch

To use Amazon CloudSearch, you need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Your AWS account
enables you to access Amazon CloudSearch and other AWS services, such as Amazon Simple
Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). As with other AWS
services, you pay only for the Amazon CloudSearch resources you use. There are no sign up fees
and charges are not incurred until you create a search domain.

If you already have an AWS account, you are automatically signed up for Amazon CloudSearch.

Before You Begin API Version 2013-01-01 11


-----

**To create an AWS account**

1. [Go to https://aws.amazon.com and click Sign Up Now.](https://aws.amazon.com)

2. Follow the instructions to sign up. You will need to enter payment information before you can
begin using Amazon CloudSearch.

### Step 1: Create an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

An Amazon CloudSearch domain encapsulates a collection of data you want to search, the search
instances that process your search requests, and a configuration that controls how your data is
indexed and searched. You create a separate search domain for each collection of data you want
to make searchable. For each domain, you configure indexing options that describe the fields
you want to include in your index and how you want to use them, analysis schemes that specify

language-specific text processing options for individual fields, expressions that you can use to
customize how search results are ranked, and access policies that control access to the domain's
document and search endpoints.

You interact with a search domain to:

- Configure index and search options

- Submit data for indexing

- Perform searches

Each domain has a unique endpoint through which you submit search requests to the domain. For
example, the endpoint for a domain called movies created in the US East (N. Virginia) region might
be:

**Example**
```
 search-movies-mtshfsu2rje7ywr66uit3dei4m.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com

```
When creating a search domain, you specify a unique name for the domain. Domain names must
start with a letter or number and be at least 3 and no more than 28 characters long. The allowed
characters are: a-z, 0-9, and hyphen (-). By default, new domains are created in the US East (N.
Virginia) region. To create a domain in another region, you must explicitly specify the region when
creating the domain.

Step 1: Create a Search Domain API Version 2013-01-01 12


-----

To configure the new domain, you must specify:

- Indexing options for the data you want to search.

- Access policies for the domain's document service and search service endpoints.

This tutorial shows you how to create and interact with a domain using the Amazon CloudSearch
console. To learn more, see Creating a Search Domain.

**Important**

The domain you're about to create will be live and you will incur the standard Amazon
CloudSearch usage fees for the domain until you delete it. For more information about
[Amazon CloudSearch usage rates, go to the Amazon CloudSearch detail page.](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/)

**To create your movies domain**

1. [Go to the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. Choose Create domain.

3. Enter a name for your new domain. Domain names must start with a letter or number and
be at least 3 and no more than 28 characters. Domain names can contain the following
characters: a-z (lower case), 0-9, and - (hyphen). Upper case letters and underscores are not
allowed.

4. Leave the other settings as their defaults and choose Next.

5. Select Sample data and choose IMDb movies (demo) from the dropdown. You can also
automatically configure a search domain by analyzing a sample of your data.

6. Choose Next.

7. Review the index fields being configured. Eleven fields are configured automatically for
the imdb-movie data: actors, directors, genres, image_url, plot, rank, rating, release_date,
running_time_secs, title, and year.

**Note**

By default, all options are enabled for each field. While this is convenient for
development and testing, fine-tuning the options configured for each field according

Step 1: Create a Search Domain API Version 2013-01-01 13


-----

to how you use those fields can reduce the size of your index. If your domain uses more
than a single small search instance, tuning can help minimize the cost of running your
domain.


When you finish reviewing the indexing options, choose Next.

8. For simplicity in this tutorial, use an open access domain. Choose Allow open access to the
**domain and choose Next.**

9. Review the domain configuration and click Create to create your domain.

Amazon CloudSearch initializes resources for the domain, which can take about ten minutes.
During this initialization process, the status of the domain is Processing. Once the status changes
to Active, you can upload your data and start searching.

### Step 2: Upload Data to Amazon CloudSearch for Indexing

You upload the data you want to search to your domain so that Amazon CloudSearch can build and
deploy a searchable index. To be indexed by Amazon CloudSearch, the data must be formatted in
either JSON or XML. The Amazon CloudSearch console can automatically convert the following file
types to the required format:

- Document batches formatted in JSON or XML (.json, .xml)

- Comma Separated Value (.csv)

- Text Documents (.txt)

When you upload a CSV file, Amazon CloudSearch parses each row separately. The first row defines
the document fields, and each subsequent row becomes a separate document. For all other file
types Amazon CloudSearch creates a single document and the contents of the file are mapped to
a single text field. If metadata is available for the file, the metadata is mapped to corresponding
document fieldsâthe fields generated from the document metadata vary depending on the file
type.

The sample IMDb movies data is already formatted in JSON.

This tutorial shows how to submit data through the Amazon CloudSearch console, but you can
also convert and upload documents with the command line tools, and upload documents using the

Step 2: Upload Data for Indexing API Version 2013-01-01 14


-----

```
documents/batch resource. (To upload more than 5 MB of data, you must use the command line

```
tools or API.)

**To upload the sample data to your movies domain**

1. [Go to the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In the left navigation pane, choose Domains. Choose the name of your movies domain to view
the domain dashboard.

3. Choose Actions, Upload documents.

4. Select Sample data and choose IMDb movies (demo) from the dropown.

5. Choose Next.

6. Review the upload summary and choose Upload documents to send the data to your domain
for indexing.

**Note**

To see how the data is formatted, choose Download the generated document batch.
For more information about preparing your own data, see Preparing Your Data.

You now have a fully functional Amazon CloudSearch domain that you can start searching. Updates
are applied continuously in the order they are received, so you can start searching your domain
right away.

### Step 3: Search Your Amazon CloudSearch Domain

You can use the search tester in the Amazon CloudSearch console to submit sample search
requests and view the results. You can also submit sample search requests through a Web browser
or using cURL. In your application, you can use any HTTP library to send search traffic to your
Amazon CloudSearch domain.

#### Searching with the Search Tester

The search tester in the Amazon CloudSearch console enables you to submit sample search
requests using any of the supported query parsers: simple, structured, lucene, or dismax. By
default, requests are processed with the simple query parser. You can specify options for the

Step 3: Search Your Domain API Version 2013-01-01 15


-----

selected parser, filter and sort the results, and browse the configured facets. The search hits
are automatically highlighted in the search results. For information about how this is done,
see Highlighting Search Hits in Amazon CloudSearch. You can also select a suggester to get
suggestions as you enter terms in the Search field. (You must configure a suggester before you
can get suggestions. For more information see Getting Autocomplete Suggestions in Amazon
CloudSearch.)

By default, results are sorted according to an automatically-generated relevance score, _score. For
information about customizing how results are ranked, see Sorting Results in Amazon CloudSearch.

**To search your domain**

1. [Go to the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In the left navigation panel, choose your movies domain to open its configuration.

3. Choose Run a test search.

4. To perform a simple text search, enter a search query and choose Run. By default, all text and
```
  text-array fields are searched.

```
To search particular fields, expand Options and enter a comma-separated list of the fields you
want to search for in the Search fields field. You can append a weight to each field with a caret
(^) to control the relative importance of each field in the search results. For example, specifying
```
title^5, description weights hits in the title field five times more than hits in the
description field when calculating relevance scores for each matching document.

```
To use the structured query syntax, select Structured from the Query parser menu. Once you've
selected the structured query parser, enter your structured query in the Search field and choose
**Run. For example, to find all of the movies with star in the title that were released in the year 2000**

or earlier, you could enter: (and title:'star' year:{,2000]). For more information, see
Constructing Compound Queries. To submit Lucene or DisMax queries, select the appropriate query
parser.

You can specify additional options for the selected query parser to configure the default operator
and control which operators can be used in a query. For more information, see Search Request
Parameters.

You can copy and paste the request URL to submit the request and view the response from a Web
browser. Requests can be sent via HTTP or HTTPS.

Searching with the Search Tester API Version 2013-01-01 16


-----

#### Submitting Search Requests from a Web Browser

You can submit search requests directly to your search endpoint from any Web browser. You
can use any of the query parsers (simple, structured, lucene, or dismax) and specify a variety of
options to constrain your search, request facet information, customize ranking, and control what
information is returned in the results.

For example, to search your movies domain and get the titles of all of the available Star Wars
movies, append the following search string to your search endpoint. (2013-01-01 is the API version
and must be specified.)

**Example**
```
 /2013-01-01/search?q=star+wars&return=title

```
**Note**

Your domain's search endpoint is shown on the domain dashboard. You can also perform a
search from the AWS Management Console, view the raw request and response, and copy
the request URL from the Search Request field. A domain's search and document service
endpoints remain the same for the life of the domain.

By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns the response in JSON. You can also get the search results

formatted in XML by specifying the format parameter, format=xml. (Note that errors can be
returned in either JSON or XML, depending on where the error originated.)

#### Searching Numeric Fields

You can use the structured query syntax, q.parser=structured, to find documents that have
particular numeric attributes. You can search for an exact value or a range of values within any

numeric field (double, double-array, int, int-array). To search for a range, you specify the
upper and lower bounds, separated by a comma, and enclose the range in brackets or braces. Use
square brackets ([,]) when you want to include the bounds, and curly braces ({,}) to exclude the
bounds. For example:

- year:2000 matches documents whose year field contains the value 2000.

- year:[2000,} matches documents whose year field contains a value greater than or equal to

2000

Submitting Search Requests from a Web Browser API Version 2013-01-01 17


-----

- year:{,2000] matches documents whose year field contains a value less than or equal to 2000

- year:[2000,2011] matches documents whose year field contains a value between 2000 and

2011, inclusive.

- year:{2000,2011} matches documents whose year field contains a value between 2000 and

2011, exclusive.

You can also search date fields for a specific date or date range, but

you must enclose each date string in single quotes: release_date:
```
['2000-01-01T00:00:00Z','2011-01-01T00:00:00Z'].

```
For example, the following structured query searches for "star" in the title field, finds all of the
matching movies that were released before 2000, and returns the title, year, and relevance score
for each one:

**Example**
```
 q=(and title:'star' year:{,2000])&q.parser=structured&return=title,year,_score

```
The response shows the status of the request, the number of matching documents, and the
requested fields for each hit.
```
 {
   "status": {
     "rid": "hLPckLsoEQoELQo=",
     "time-ms": 2

         "fields": {
           "title": "Star Wars",
           "year": "1977",
           "_score": "5.7601414"
         }
       },

        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

For more information about constructing search queries, see Searching Your Data with Amazon
CloudSearch.

#### Sorting the Search Results

By default, Amazon CloudSearch sorts the search results according to an automatically generated

relevance _score. You can change how results are ranked by using the sort parameter in your
search request to specify the field or expression you want to use for ranking. (An expression is
a custom numeric expression that can be evaluated for each document in the set of matching
documents. For information about defining your own expressions, see Configuring Expressions.)

If you specify a text field with the sort parameter, the results are sorted alphabetically according
to that field. For example, to sort results from your movies domain alphabetically by title, add
```
&sort=title asc to your query string:

```
**Example**
```
 2013-01-01/search?q=(and genres:'Sci-Fi' year:
 {,2000])&q.parser=structured&return=title,year&sort=title asc

```
Note that you must explicitly specify the sort direction, asc (ascending) or desc (descending).
When you sort alphabetically, Amazon CloudSearch sorts by Unicode codepoint. This means
numbers come before letters and uppercase letters come before lowercase letters. Numbers are
sorted as strings; for example, 10 will come before 2.

Similarly, you can specify an integer field with the sort parameter to sort the results numerically.

Sorting the Search Results API Version 2013-01-01 19


-----

If you specify a comma separated list of fields or expressions, the first field or expression is used as
the primary sort criteria, the second is used as the secondary sort criteria, and so on.

For more information about ranking results, see Sorting Results in Amazon CloudSearch

#### Getting Facet Information

A facet is an index field that represents a category that you want to use to refine and filter
search results. When you submit search requests to Amazon CloudSearch, you can request facet
information to find out how many hits share the same value in a facet. You can display this
information along with the search results and use it to enable users to interactively refine their
searches. (This is often referred to as faceted navigation or faceted search.)

A facet can be any date, literal, or numeric field that has faceting enabled in your domain
configuration. For each facet, Amazon CloudSearch calculates the number of hits that share the
same value. You can define buckets to calculate facet counts for particular subsets of the facet
values. Only buckets that have matches are included in the facet results.

**To get facet counts with your search results**

- Use the facet.FIELD option to specify a field for which you want to compute facets. For the

sample IMDb movies data faceting is enabled for the following fields: genres, rank, rating,
```
  release_date, running_time_secs, and year. Facet options are specified as a JSON

```
object. If the JSON object is empty, facet.FIELD={}, facet counts are computed for all field
values, the facets are sorted by facet count, and the top 10 facets are returned in the results:
```
   q=star&return=title&facet.genres={}

```
The facets appear below the hits in the results.
```
 facets": {
   "genres": {
     "buckets": [
       {"value": "Comedy","count": 41},
       .
       .
       .
       {"value": "Sport", "count": 7}
     ]

```
Getting Facet Information API Version 2013-01-01 20


-----

```
  }
}

```

You can specify options to calculate facets for selected field values, specify the maximum number

of facet values to include in the results, and control how the facets are sorted.

To define buckets to compute facet counts for selected field values, you specify the buckets
option. For example, the following request sorts the facet counts for the year field by decade:
```
 q=star&facet.year={buckets:["[1970,1979]","[1980,1989]","[1990,1999]"]}

```
This constrains the facet counts to the three specified ranges:
```
 "facets": {
     "year": {
       "buckets": [
         {"value": "[1970,1979]", "count": 3},
         {"value": "[1980,1989]","count": 7},
         {"value": "[1990,1999]","count": 12}
       ]
     }
 }

```
For more information about specifying facet options, see Getting and Using Facet Information in
Amazon CloudSearch.

#### Getting Search Highlights

A search highlight is an excerpt of a text or text-array field that shows where the search term
occurs within the field.

**To get highlight information with your search results**

- Use the highlight.FIELD option to specify the text or text-array field you want to get
highlights for. The field must be highlight enabled in your domain's indexing options. For

the sample IMDb movies data highlighting is enabled for the following fields: actors,
```
  directors, plot, and title. Highlight options are specified as a JSON object. If the JSON

```
object is empty, highlight.FIELD={}, Amazon CloudSearch highlights all occurrences

of the search term(s) by enclosing them in HTML emphasis tags, <em>term</em>, and the
excerpts are returned as HTML.

   "found": 29,
   "start": 0,
   "hit": [
     {
       "id": "tt0796366",

### Step 4: Delete Your Amazon CloudSearch Movies Domain

When you are finished experimenting with your movies domain, you must delete it to avoid
**incurring additional usage fees.**

**Important**

Deleting a domain deletes the index associated with the domain and takes the domain's
document and search endpoints offline permanently.

to populate the new domain using the 2013-01-01 data format, and update your query pipeline
to submit requests in the 2013-01-01 request format. This migration guide summarizes the API
changes and highlights the ones that are most likely to affect your application.

### Creating 2013-01-01 Amazon CloudSearch Domains

If you created Amazon CloudSearch domains prior to the launch of the 2013-01-01 API, you can
choose which API version to use when you create a new domain. To create a 2013-01-01 domain
through the console, select the 2013-01-01 version in the Create Domain Wizard. To create a

2013-01-01 domain from the command line, download and install the AWS CLI and run the aws
```
cloudsearch create-domain command.

```
**Note**

To create and interact with 2013-01-01 domains, you must use the AWS CLI tools. To create
and interact with 2011-02-01 domains, you must use the v1 tools.

### Configuring 2013-01-01 Amazon CloudSearch Domains

You can configure 2013-01-01 domains through the console, command line tools, or AWS SDKs.
2013-01-01 domains support several new configuration options:

- Analysis Schemesâyou configure analysis schemes to specify language-specific text processing

options for text and text-array fields. Amazon CloudSearch now supports 33 languages,
as well as an option for multi-language fields. For more information, see Configuring Analysis
Schemes. For the complete list of supported languages, see Supported Languages.

- Availability Optionsâyou can enable the Multi-AZ option to expand a domain into a second

availability zone to ensure availability in the event of a service disruption. For more information,
see Configuring Availability Options.

Creating 2013-01-01 Domains API Version 2013-01-01 24


-----

- Scaling Optionsâyou can set the desired instance type and desired replication count to increase

upload or search capacity, speed up search requests, and improve fault tolerance. For more
information, see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

- Suggestersâyou can configure suggesters to implement autocomplete functionality. For more

information, see Configuring Suggesters for Amazon CloudSearch.

Access to the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service is managed through IAM and now enables
you to control access to specific configuration actions. Note that the Amazon CloudSearch ARN has
also changed. Access to your domain's document and search endpoints is managed through the
Amazon CloudSearch configuration service. For more information, see configure access policies.

2013-01-01 domains also support an expanded set of indexing options:

- Analysis Schemeâyou configure language-specific text-processing on a per field basis by

specifying an analysis scheme for each text and text-array field. For more information, see
Configuring Analysis Schemes.

- Field TypesâAmazon CloudSearch now supports 11 field types:

 - dateâcontains a timestamp. Dates and times are specified in UTC (Coordinated Universal

Time) according to IETF RFC3339: yyyy-mm-ddT00:00:00Z. In UTC, for example, 5:00 PM
August 23, 1970 is: 1970-08-23T17:00:00Z.

 - date-arrayâa date field that can contain multiple values.

 - doubleâcontains a double-precision 64-bit floating point value.

 - double-arrayâa double field that can contain multiple values.

 - intâcontains a 64-bit signed integer value.

 - int-arrayâan integer field that can contain multiple values.

 - latlonâcontains a location stored as a latitude and longitude value pair.

 - literalâcontains an identifier or other data that you want to be able to match exactly.

 - literal-arrayâa literal field that can contain multiple values.

 - textâcontains arbitrary alphanumeric data.

 - text-arrayâa text field that can contain multiple values.

- Highlightâwhen you enable the highlight option for a field, you can retrieve excerpts that show

where the search terms occur within that field. For more information, see Highlighting Search
Hits in Amazon CloudSearch.

Configuring 2013-01-01 Domains API Version 2013-01-01 25


-----

- Sourceâyou can specify a source for a field to copy data from one field to another, enabling you

to use the same source data in different ways by configuring different options for the fields.

When configuring your 2013-01-01 domain, there are several things to keep in mind:

- By default, when you add a field, all options valid for that field type are enabled. While this is

useful for development and testing, disabling options you don't need can reduce the size of your
index and improve performance.

- You must use the separate array type fields for multi-valued fields.

- Only single-value fields can be sort enabled.

- Only text and text-array fields can be highlight enabled.

- All fields except `text and text-array fields can be facet enabled.`

- Literal fields are now case-sensitive.

- You no longer have to store floating point values as integersâuse a double field.

- You can store locations using the new latlon field type. For more information, see location
based searching and sorting.

- An int field is a 64-bit signed integer.

- Instead of configuring a default search field, you can specify which fields to search with the
```
 q.options parameter in your search requests. The q.options parameter also enables you to

```
specify weights for each of the fields.

- When sorting and configuring expressions, you reference the default relevance score with the

name _score. Due to changes in the relevance algorithm, the calculated scores will be different
than they were under the 2011-02-01 API. For more information, see Configuring Expressions.

- Expressions now support the logn, atan2, and haversin functions as well as the _score (text

relevance score) and _time (epoch time) variables. If you store locations in latlon fields, you

can reference the latitude and longitude values as FIELD.latitude and FIELD.longitude.

You can also reference both int and double fields in expressions. The following functions

are no longer supported: cs.text_relevance, erf, lgamma, rand, and time. For more
information, see Configuring Expressions.

For more information about configuring indexing options for a 2013-01-01 domain, see configure
indexing options. For more information about configuring availability options, scaling options, text
processing options, suggesters, and expressions see Creating and Managing Search Domains.

### Uploading Data to 2013-01-01 Amazon CloudSearch Domains

With the 2013-01-01 API, you no longer have to specify document versionsâupdates are applied

in the order they are received. You also no longer specify the lang attribute for each documentâ

you control language-specific text processing by configuring an analysis scheme for each text and
```
text-array field.

```
To upload your data to a 2013-01-01 domain, you need to:

- Omit the version and lang attributes from your document batches.

- Make sure all of the document fields correspond to index fields configured for your domain.

Unrecognized fields are no longer ignored, they will generate an error.

- Post the document batches to your 2013-01-01 domain's doc endpoint. Note that

you must specify the 2013-01-01 API version. For example, the following request

posts the batch contained in data1.json to the doc-movies-123456789012.us```
 east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com endpoint.
  curl -X POST --upload-file data1.json doc-movies-123456789012.us-east-1.
  cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/documents/batch --header "Content-Type:
  application/json"

```
The 2013-01-01 API supports prescaling your domain to increase upload capacity. If you have a
large amount of data to upload, configure your domain's scaling options and select a larger desired
instance type. Moving to a larger instance type enables you to upload batches in parallel and
reduces the time it takes for the data to be indexed. For more information, see Configuring Scaling
Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

### Searching 2013-01-01 Amazon CloudSearch Domains

Much of the effort required to migrate an existing Amazon CloudSearch search domain to the
2013-01-01 API is updating your query pipeline to submit 2013-01-01 compatible search requests.

- Use the 2013-01-01 API version in all requests.

- Use the q parameter to specify search criteria for all requests. The bq parameter is no longer

supported. To use the structured (Boolean) search syntax, specify q.parser=structured in the
request.

- Parameters cannot be repeated in a search request.

- The wildcard character (*) is only supported when using the simple query parser. Use the prefix

operator to perform prefix matching with the structured query parser. For example, q=(prefix
```
 'oce')&q.parser=structured.

```
- Use the field name _id to reference the document ID field in a search request. The docid field

name is no longer supported.

- Use the range operator search a field for a value within the specified range. The filter

operator is no longer supported.

- Use the new range syntax to search for ranges of values, including dates and locations stored

in latlon fields. The double dot (..) notation is no longer supported. Separate the upper and
lower bounds with a comma (,), and enclose the range in brackets or braces. A square bracket
([,]) indicates that the bound is included, a curly brace ({,}) excludes the bound. For example,
```
 year:2008..2011 is now expressed as year:[2008,2011]. An open ended range such as
 year:..2011 is now expressed as year:{,2011].

```
- Use the term operator to search a field for a particular value. The field operator is no longer

supported.

- Use the q.options parameter to specify field weights. The cs.text_relevance function is no

longer supported. For example, q.options={fields:['title^2','plot^0.5']}.

- Use the fq parameter to filter results without affecting how the matching documents are scored

and sorted.

- Use a dot (.) as a separator rather than a hyphen (-) in the prefix parameters: expr.NAME,
```
 facet.FIELD, highlight.FIELD.

```
- Use the facet.FIELD parameter to specify all facet options. The facet-FIELD-top-N,
```
 facet-FIELD-sort, and facet-FIELD-constraints parameters are no longer supported.

```
Searching 2013-01-01 Domains API Version 2013-01-01 29


-----

- Use the sort parameter to specify the fields or expressions you want to use for sorting. You

must explicitly specify the sort direction in the sort parameter. For example, sort=rank asc,
```
 date desc. The rank parameter is no longer supported.

```
- Use expr.NAME to define an expression in a search request. The rank-RANKNAME parameter is

no longer supported.

- Use format=xml to get results as XML. The result-type parameter is no longer supported.

The 2013-01-01 search API also supports several new features:

- Term boostingâuse the boost option in a structured query to increase the importance of one

part of the query relative to the other parts. For more information, see Constructing Compound
Queries.

- Sloppy phrase searchâuse the near operator in a structured query to search a text or text```
 array field for multiple terms and find documents that contain the terms within the specified

```
distance of one another. You can also perform a sloppy phrase search with the simple query

parser by appending the ~ operator and a value to the phrase. For more information, see
Searching for Phrases.

- Fuzzy searchâuse the ~ operator to perform fuzzy searches with the simple query parser.

Append the ~ operator and a value to a term to indicate how much terms can differ and still be
considered a match. For more information, see Searching for Individual Terms.

- Highlightingâuse the highlight.FIELD parameter to highlight matches in a particular field.

For more information, see Highlighting Search Hits in Amazon CloudSearch.

- Autocompleteâconfigure a suggester and submit requests to the suggester resource to get a

list of query completions and the documents in which they were found. For more information,
see Getting Autocomplete Suggestions in Amazon CloudSearch.

- Partial search resultsâuse the partial=true parameter to retrieve partial results when one

or more index partitions are unavailable. By default Amazon CloudSearch only returns results if
every partition can be queried.

- Deep pagingâuse the cursor parameter to paginate results when you have a large result set.

For more information, see Paginate the results.

- Match all documentsâuse the matchall structured query operator to retrieve all of the

documents in the index.

- New query parsersâuse the q.parser parameter to select the Lucene or DisMax parsers instead

of the simple or structured parser, q.parser=lucene or q.parser=dismax.

Searching 2013-01-01 Domains API Version 2013-01-01 30


-----

You'll also notice some changes in behavior when searching:

- Strings are no longer tokenized on case boundaries and periods that aren't followed by a

space are considered part of the term. For more information, see Text Processing in Amazon
CloudSearch.

- Literal fields are now case-sensitive.

- Search responses no longer include the rank, match expression, or CPU time. The only status

information returned is the resource ID (rid) and processing time (time-ms).

- When you get facet information for an int field, min and max values are no longer returned.

For more information about searching your data, see Searching Your Data with Amazon
CloudSearch and the Search API.

## Creating and Managing Amazon CloudSearch Domains

A search domain encapsulates the data you want to search, indexing options that control how
you can search the data and what information you can retrieve from your search domain, and
the search instances that index your data and process search requests. You can create, monitor,
and delete domains using the Amazon CloudSearch console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. All domain
management actions are implemented by the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service. For more
information, see the Configuration API Reference for Amazon CloudSearch .

- Configuring Domain Endpoint Options in Amazon CloudSearch

- Monitoring Amazon CloudSearch Domains

- Deleting an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

- Tagging Amazon CloudSearch Domains

### Creating an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

To search your data with Amazon CloudSearch, the first thing you need to do is create a search
domain. If you have multiple collections of data that you want to make searchable, you can create
multiple search domains. Before you can send search requests to a new domain, you must also
configure access policies, configure index fields, and upload the data you want to search.

When you create a search domain, you must give it a unique name. Domain names must start with
a letter or number and be at least 3 and no more than 28 characters long. The allowed characters
are: a-z, 0-9, and hyphen (-). Upper case letters, underscores (_), and other special characters are
not allowed in domain names.

By default, all new domains are created using the 2013-01-01 API version. If you have previously
created search domains with the 2011-02-01 API version, you can opt to use the old API for your
new domain. However, we recommend using the 2013-01-01 API for all new use cases. All domains
will need to migrate to the 2013-01-01 API when the 2011-02-01 API is retired.

Creating a Search Domain API Version 2013-01-01 34


-----

You can choose the AWS region where you want to create your search domain. Typically, you
should choose the region closest to your operations. For example, if you reside in Europe, create
your search domain in the Europe (Ireland) region (eu-west-1). For a current list of supported
[regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints. For more information about choosing a region,](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)
see Regions and Endpoints for Amazon CloudSearch.

**Note**

Amazon CloudSearch domains in different regions are entirely independent. For example, if
you create a search domain called my-domain in us-east-1, and another domain called my_domain in eu-west-1, they are completely independent and do not share any data._

Each search domain has unique endpoints through which you upload data for indexing and submit

search requests. A domain's document and search endpoints remain the same for the life of the
domain. For example, the endpoints for a domain called imdb-movies might be:
```
 doc-imdb-movies-nypdffbzrfkoudsurkxvgwbpi4.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com
 search-imdb-movies-nypdffbzrfkoudsurkxvgwbpi4.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com

```
**Important**

By default, access to a new domain's document and search endpoints is blocked for all IP
addresses. You must configure access policies for the domain to be able to submit search
requests to the domain's search endpoint and upload data from the command line or
through the domain's document endpoint. You can upload documents and search the
domain through the Amazon CloudSearch console without configuring access policies.

You can create a search domain from the Amazon CloudSearch console, using the aws
```
cloudsearch create-domain command, or using one of the AWS SDKs.

-----

#### Creating a Domain Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

The Amazon CloudSearch console enables you to easily create new search domains and provides a
variety of options for configuring indexing options.

**To create a domain**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon CloudSearch console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. Choose Create domain.

3. Enter a name for your new domain. Domain names must start with a letter or number and
be at least 3 and no more than 28 characters long. Domain names can contain the following
characters: a-z (lower case), 0-9, and - (hyphen). Upper case letters, underscores (_), and other
special characters are not allowed in domain names.

Optionally, you can set the Desired instance type and Desired replication count to prescale
your domain. For more information, see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

4. Choose Next.

5. In the configuring options, select Manual configuration and choose Next.

6. Configure the index fields for the domain. For instructions, see configure indexing options.

7. Choose Next.

8. Configure the domain access policy. For instructions, see configure access policies.

**Note**

Until you configure access policies, you will only be able to upload documents and
submit search queries through the console. By default, the document and search
endpoints are configured to block all IP addresses.

9. Choose Next.

10. Review the domain configuration and choose Create.

The domain's document and search service endpoints are displayed on the domain dashboard
when the domain becomes active. At that point, you can upload documents for indexing and start
searching your data.

Creating a Domain Using the Console API Version 2013-01-01 36


-----

#### Creating a Domain Using the AWS CLI

You use the aws cloudsearch create-domain command to create search domains. For
[information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

[User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

**To create a domain**

- Run the aws cloudsearch create-domain command and specify the name of the domain

you want to create with the --domain-name option. For example, to create a domain called
_movies:_

**Example**
```
   aws cloudsearch create-domain --domain-name movies
   {
    "DomainStatus": {
      "DomainId": "965407640801/movies", 
      "Created": true, 
      "Deleted": false, 
      "SearchInstanceCount": 0, 
      "DomainName": "movies", 
      "SearchService": {}, 
      "RequiresIndexDocuments": false, 
      "Processing": false, 
      "DocService": {}, 
      "ARN": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:us-east-1:965407640801:domain/movies", 
      "SearchPartitionCount": 0
    }
   }

```
The aws cloudsearch create-domain command returns immediately. It takes about ten

minutes to create endpoints for a new domain. You can use the aws cloudsearch describe```
domains command to view a summary of the domain's status and configuration. For more

```
information, see Getting Information About an Amazon CloudSearch Domain.

**Important**

Once a domain's endpoints are active, they remain the same for the life of the domain. You
should cache the endpointsâthere's no need to query for the endpoint before submitting

a document or search service request and doing so is likely to result in your requests being
throttled.


#### Creating an Amazon CloudSearch Domain Using the AWS SDKs

The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including CreateDomain. For more
[information about installing and using the AWS SDKs, see AWS Software Development Kits.](http://aws.amazon.com/code)

### Configuring Access for Amazon CloudSearch

You use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies to control access to the

Amazon CloudSearch configuration service and each search domain's document, search, and
suggest services. An IAM access policy is a JSON document that explicitly lists permissions that
define what actions people or processes are allowed to perform. For an introduction to IAM access
[policies, see Overview of AWS IAM Policies.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html)

You control access to the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service APIs and the domain services
APIs independently. For example, you might choose to restrict who can modify the configuration
of your production domain, but allow team members to create and manage their own domains
for development and testing. Similarly, you might configure your development and test domains
to accept anonymous requests to the upload, search, and suggest services, but lock down your
production domain so that it accepts only authenticated requests from your application.

When AWS receives a request, it authenticates that the request is from a known AWS user, and
then checks relevant policies to determine whether the user is authorized to perform the requested
actions using the requested resources. If a user has not been explicitly granted permission to
perform an action, the request is denied. During policy evaluation, if AWS encounters an explicit
deny, the deny effect takes precedence over any explicit allow effects that are in force.

**Important**

To enable authentication, Amazon CloudSearch requests must be signed with an access
key. The only exception is if you allow anonymous access to a domain's upload, search, or
suggest services. For more information, see Signing Requests.

#### Writing Access Policies for Amazon CloudSearch

Amazon CloudSearch supports both user-based policies and resource-based policies:

- User-based policies are attached to a particular IAM role, group, or user. A user-based policy

specifies which of your account's search domains a person or process can access and what
actions they can perform. To attach a user-based policy to a user, group, or role, you use the IAM
console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You must define user-based policies to control access to the
**Amazon CloudSearch configuration service actions. (The user in this context isn't necessarily**
a person, it's just an identity with associated permissions. For example, you might create a user
to represent an application that needs to have credentials to submit search requests to your
domain.)

- Resource-based policies for Amazon CloudSearch are attached to a particular search domain.

A resource-based policy specifies who has access to the search domain and which domain
services they can use. Resource-based policies control access only to a particular domain's
document, search, and suggest services; they cannot be used to configure access to the Amazon
CloudSearch configuration service actions. To attach a resource-based policy to a domain, you
use the Amazon CloudSearch console, AWS CLI or AWS SDKs.

In general, we recommend managing access to Amazon CloudSearch APIs by configuring userbased policies. This enables you to manage all of your permissions in one place and any changes
you need to make take effect almost immediately. However, to allow public access to a domain's
search service or restrict access based on IP addresses, you must configure a resource-based policy
for the domain. (We recommend replacing your old IP based access policies with user-based
policies at your earliest convenience.) You can also use resource-based policies to easily allow other
accounts to access a domain. Keep in mind that processing changes to a domain's resource-based
policies takes significantly longer than applying changes to user-based policies.

Writing Access Policies for Amazon CloudSearch API Version 2013-01-01 39


-----

The IAM console can help you write both user-based and resource-based policies for Amazon
[CloudSearch. For more information, see Managing IAM Policies.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingPolicies.html)

##### Contents of an Access Policy for Amazon CloudSearch

You specify the following information in your access policies for Amazon CloudSearch:

- Version specifies the policy language version that the statement is compatible with. The

version is always set to 2012-10-17.

- Resource is the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the domain to which a user-based policy

applies. Resource is not specified in resource-based policies configured through the Amazon
CloudSearch configuration service, because the policy is attached directly to the resource. For
more information about Amazon CloudSearch ARNs, see Amazon CloudSearch ARNs.

- Effect specifies whether the statement authorizes or blocks access to the specified action(s). It

must be Allow or Deny

- Sid is an optional string that you can use to provide a descriptive name for the policy statement.

- Action specifies which Amazon CloudSearch actions the statement applies to. For the

supported actions, see Amazon CloudSearch Actions. You can use a wildcard (*) as the action
to configure access for all actions when you need to grant administrative access to select
users. (In this case, you might also want to enable multi-factor authorization for additional
[security. For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access.) Wildcards are also](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingMFA.html)

supported within action names. For example, "Action":["cloudsearch:Describe*]

matches all of the configuration service Describe actions, such as DescribeDomains and
```
 DescribeServiceAccessPolicies.

```
- Condition specifies conditions for when the policy is in effect. When configuring anonymous,

IP-based access, you would specify the IP addresses that the access rule applies to, for example
```
 "IpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": ["192.0.2.0/32"]}.

```
- Principal specifies who is allowed access to the domain in a resource-based policy.
```
 Principal is not specified in user-based policies configured through IAM. The Principal

```
value for a resource-based policy can specify other AWS accounts or users in your own account.

For example, to grant access to the account 555555555555, you would specify "Principal":
```
 {"AWS":["arn:aws:iam::555555555555:root"]}. Specifying a wildcard (*) enables

```
anonymous access to the domain. Anonymous access is not recommended. If you enable
anonymous access, you should at least specify a condition to restrict which IP addresses can
submit requests to the domain. For more information, see Granting Access to a Domain from
Selected IP Addresses.

Examples.

**Amazon CloudSearch ARNs**

A policy's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) uniquely specifies the domain that the policy
applies to. The ARN is a standard format that AWS uses to identify resources. The 12-digit

number in the ARN is your AWS account ID. Amazon CloudSearch ARNs are of the form
```
arn:aws:cloudsearch:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID:domain/DOMAIN-NAME.

```
The following list describes the variable elements in the ARN:

- REGION is the AWS region where the Amazon CloudSearch domain for which you are configuring

permissions resides. You can use a wildcard (*) for the REGION for all regions.

- ACCOUNT-ID is your AWS account ID with no hyphens; for example, 111122223333.

- DOMAIN-NAME identifies a specific search domain. You can use a wildcard (*) for the DOMAIN```
 NAME for all of your account's domains in the specified region. If you have multiple domains

```
whose names start with the same prefix, you can use a wildcard to match all of those domains.

For example, dev-* matches dev-test, dev-movies, dev-sandbox, and so on. Note that if
you name new domains with the same prefix, the policy also applies to those new domains.

For example, the following ARN identifies the movies domain in the us-east-1 region owned by
account 111122223333:
```
 arn:aws:cloudsearch:us-east-1:111122223333:domain/movies

```
The following example shows how the ARN is used to specify the resource in a user-based policy.
```
 {
  "Version":"2012-10-17",      
  "Statement": [
   {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["cloudsearch:search"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:us-east-1:111122223333:domain/movies"
   }
  ]
 }

```
Writing Access Policies for Amazon CloudSearch API Version 2013-01-01 41


-----

A domain's ARN is displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console and is

also available by calling DescribeDomains.

**Important**

When specifying an ARN for a domain created with the 2011-02-01 API, you must use

the former Amazon CloudSearch service name, cs. For example, arn:aws:cs:us```
   east-1:111122223333:domain/movies. If you need to define policies that configure

```
access for both 2011 and 2013 domains, make sure to specify the correct ARN format for
each domain. For more information, see Configuration Service Access Policies Not Working.

**Amazon CloudSearch Actions**

The actions you specify control which Amazon CloudSearch APIs the statement applies to. All

Amazon CloudSearch actions are prefixed with cloudsearch:, such as cloudsearch:search.
The following list shows the supported actions:

- cloudsearch:document allows access to the document service API. Permission to use the
```
 document action is required to upload documents to a search domain for indexing.

```
- cloudsearch:search allows access to the search API. Permission to use the search action is

required to submit search requests to a domain.

- cloudsearch:suggest allows access to the suggest API. Permission to use the suggest action

is required to get suggestions from a domain.

- cloudsearch:CONFIGURATION-ACTION allows access to the specified configuration service

action. Permission to use the DescribeDomains and ListDomainNames configuration actions
is required to access the Amazon CloudSearch console. Configuration actions can be specified
only in user-based policies. For the complete list of actions, see Actions.

#### Amazon CloudSearch Policy Examples

This section presents a few examples of Amazon CloudSearch access policies.

**Topics**

- Granting Read-only Access to the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration Service

- Granting Access to All Amazon CloudSearch Configuration Service Actions

Amazon CloudSearch Policy Examples API Version 2013-01-01 42


-----

- Granting Unrestricted Access to All Amazon CloudSearch Services

- Granting Permission to Upload Documents to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

- Granting Amazon CloudSearch Access to Another AWS Account

- Granting Access to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain from Selected IP Addresses

- Granting Public Access to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain's Search Service

##### Granting Read-only Access to the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration Service

You can grant read-only access to the configuration service by allowing only the following actions.
This might be useful if you want to allow users to view the configuration of a production domain
without being able to make changes.

- cloudsearch:DescribeAnalysisSchemes

- cloudsearch:DescribeAvailabilityOptions

- cloudsearch:DescribeDomains

- cloudsearch:DescribeExpressions

- cloudsearch:DescribeIndexFields

- cloudsearch:DescribeScalingParameters

- cloudsearch:DescribeServiceAccessPolicies

- cloudsearch:DescribeSuggesters

- cloudsearch:ListDomainNames

The following user-based policy grants read-only access to the configuration service for a movies
domain owned by the account 555555555555. The policy uses wildcards for the actions, since it
grants access to all actions that begin with Describe or List. Note that this will also grant access to
any describe or list actions that might be added to the API in the future.
```
 {
  "Version":"2012-10-17",      
  "Statement": [
   {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["cloudsearch:Describe*", 
         "cloudsearch:List*"],

```
Amazon CloudSearch Policy Examples API Version 2013-01-01 43


-----

```
   "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:us-east-1:555555555555:domain/movies"
  }
 ]
}

```

##### Granting Access to All Amazon CloudSearch Configuration Service Actions

You can grant access to all Amazon CloudSearch configuration service actions by including an
```
Allow statement that grants access to all configuration service actions, but not the domain

```
services actions. This enables you to grant administrative access without authorizing a user to
upload or retrieve data from a domain. One way to do this is to use a wildcard to grant access to all
Amazon CloudSearch actions, and then include a deny statement that blocks access to the domain
services actions. The following user-based policy grants access to the configuration service for all

domains owned by the 111122223333 account in the us-west-2 region.
```
 {
  "Version":"2012-10-17",      
  "Statement": [
   {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["cloudsearch:*"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:us-west-2:111122223333:domain/*"
   },
   {
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": ["cloudsearch:document", 
         "cloudsearch:search", 
         "cloudsearch:suggest"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:us-west-2:111122223333:domain/*"
   }
  ] 
 }

##### Granting Unrestricted Access to All Amazon CloudSearch Services

```
You can grant unrestricted access to all Amazon CloudSearch services, including all configuration
service actions and all domain services with a user-based policy. To do this, you specify wildcards
for the actions, region, and domain name. The following policy enables the user to access all
Amazon CloudSearch actions for any domain in any region that's owned by the 111122223333
account.

   "Action": ["cloudsearch:*"],
   "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:*:111122223333:domain/*"
  }
 ]
}

```

##### Granting Permission to Upload Documents to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

You can grant a user permission to upload documents to a search domain by specifying the
```
cloudsearch:document action. For example, the following user-based policy enables the user to

```
upload documents to the movies domain in us-east-1 owned by the 111122223333 account.
```
 {
  "Version":"2012-10-17",      
  "Statement": [
   {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["cloudsearch:document"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:us-east-1:111122223333:domain/movies"
   }
  ]
 }

##### Granting Amazon CloudSearch Access to Another AWS Account

This topic provides an example of the second option, adding a resource-based policy to the

CloudSearch domain. Assume that account #1 is owned by account id 111111111111 and account

#2 is owned by account id 999999999999. Account #1 wants to grant access to account #2 to use

the search service for the movies domain, which requires two steps:

1. Account #1 attaches a resource-based policy to the domain using the Amazon CloudSearch

console that grants access to account #2.
```

     "Principal":{"AWS":["arn:aws:iam::999999999999:root"]}
    }
   ]
  }

```
2. Account #2 attaches a user-based managed policy to an IAM role owned by that account using

the IAM console.
```

-----

**Important**

To configure resource-based policies for Amazon CloudSearch, you must have permission to

use the cloudsearch:UpdateServiceAccessPolicies action.


##### Granting Access to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain from Selected IP Addresses

Resource-based access policies set through the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service support
anonymous access, which enables you to submit unsigned requests to a search domain's services.

To allow anonymous access from selected IP addresses, use a wildcard for the Principal value

and specify the allowed IP addresses as a Condition element in the policy.

**Important**

Allowing anonymous access from selected IP addresses is inherently less secure than
requiring user credentials to access your search domains. We recommend against allowing
anonymous access even if it is permitted only from select IP addresses. If you currently
allow anonymous access, you should upgrade your applications to submit signed requests
and control access by configuring user-based or resource-based policies.

If you are creating a resource-based policy that grants access to requests coming from an Amazon
EC2 instance, you need to specify the instance's public IP address.

IP addresses are specified in the standard Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format. For
example 10.24.34.0/24 specifies the range 10.24.34.0 - 10.24.34.255, while 10.24.34.0/32
[specifies the single IP address 10.24.34.0. For more information about CIDR notation, see RFC](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4632.txt)
[4632.](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4632.txt)

For example, the following policy grants access to the search action for the movies domain owned
by AWS account 111122223333 from the IP address 192.0.2.0/32.
```
 {
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
   {
    "Sid":"search_only",
    "Effect":"Allow",
    "Principal":"*",

```
Amazon CloudSearch Policy Examples API Version 2013-01-01 47


-----

```
   "Action":["cloudsearch:search"],
   "Condition":{"IpAddress":{"aws:SourceIp":"192.0.2.0/32"}}
  }
 ]
}

```

##### Granting Public Access to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain's Search Service

If you need to allow public access to your domain's search endpoint, you can configure a resourcebased policy with no conditions. This enables unsigned requests to be sent from any IP address.

**Important**

Allowing public access to a search domain means you have no control over the volume of
requests submitted to the domain. Malicious users could flood the domain with requests,
impacting legitimate users as well as your operating costs.

For example, the following policy grants public access to the search action for the movies domain
owned by AWS account 111122223333.
```
 {
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
   {
    "Sid":"public_search",
    "Effect":"Allow",
    "Principal":"*",
    "Action":["cloudsearch:search"]
   }
  ]
 }

#### Configuring Access for Amazon CloudSearch Using the AWS Management Console

**To configure resource-based policies**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon CloudSearch console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. Choose the name of the domain you want to configure.

3. On the Domain configuration tab, choose Edit next to Access policy.

4. When you're done making changes to the domain access policy, choose Submit.

Your domain remains in a Processing state while Amazon CloudSearch updates the access policy.

#### Configuring Access for Amazon CloudSearch with the AWS CLI

You can configure both user-based policies and resource-based policies for Amazon CloudSearch
[with the AWS CLI. For information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)
[Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

**To configure user-based policies**

- Configure Amazon CloudSearch permissions by attaching a policy to a user, group, or role

with the aws put-user-policy, aws put-group-policy, or aws put-role-policy
[command. For more information, see Managing Policies (AWS Management Console). For more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingPolicies.html#AddingPermissions_Console)
information about user-based policies for Amazon CloudSearch see Writing Access Policies for
Amazon CloudSearch.

**To configure resource-based policies**

- Run the aws cloudsearch update-service-access-policies command and specify

an access policy with the --access-policies option. The access policy must be enclosed
in quotes and all quotes within the access policy must be escaped with a backslash. For more
information about resource-based policies for Amazon CloudSearch see Writing Access Policies
for Amazon CloudSearch.

       \"Condition\":{\"IpAddress\":{\"aws:SourceIp\":
       \"192.0.2.0/32\"}}}]}"
     }
   }

```
Updating resource-based access policies takes some time to complete. You can check the state

of the policy with the aws cloudsearch describe-service-access-policies command.

Once the policy has been applied, the state of the policy changes to Active.

You can retrieve your domain's policies using the aws cloudsearch describe-service```
access-policies command.

### Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch

A search domain has one or more search instances, each with a finite amount of RAM and CPU
resources for indexing data and processing requests. You can configure scaling options to control
the instance type that is used, the number of instances your search index is distributed across
(partition count), and the number of replicas of each index partition (replication count). All
instances for a domain are always of the same type.

You can configure the desired instance type, partition count, or replication count for an Amazon
CloudSearch domain to:

- Increase upload capacity By default, all search domains start out on a search.small instance.

You can increase your domain's document upload capacity by changing the desired instance type.
If you have a large amount of data to uploadâfor example, when you are initially populating
your search domainâyou can choose a larger instance type to increase the number of updates
that can be submitted in parallel and reduce how long it takes to index your data. If you are
already using the largest instance type, you can increase the desired partition count to further
increase upload capacity. For more information, see Bulk Uploads. Note that increasing the
desired replication count does not generally increase a domain's upload capacity.

- Speed up search requests. Choosing a larger desired instance type can also speed up search

requests. If you've tuned your requests and still aren't meeting your performance targets, try
choosing a larger instance type. If you are already using the largest instance type, you can
increase the desired partition count to further boost query performance. For more information,
see Tuning Search Request Performance in Amazon CloudSearch.

- Increase search capacity. By default, Amazon CloudSearch uses one instance per index partition.

When Amazon CloudSearch scales the domain automatically, it adds replicas based on the
resources needed to process the query traffic. To increase a domain's search capacity, you set
the desired replication count. However, deploying additional instances takes some time. If you
know in advance that you will need additional capacityâfor example, before a big launch or
announcementâadd replicas ahead of time to ensure that your search domain is ready to handle
the load.

- Improve fault tolerance. Increasing the desired replication count also improves the domain's

fault-toleranceâif there's a problem with one of the replicas, the others will continue to
handle requests while it is being recovered. However, note that the replicas reside in the same

Availability Zone. If you need to ensure availability of your domain in the event of an Availability
Zone service disruption, you should enable the MultiAZ option. For more information, see
Configuring Availability Options.

When you set the desired instance type, desired number of replicas, or desired partition count,
Amazon CloudSearch scales your domain as necessary, but will never scale the domain to an
instance type that's smaller than the desired type, use fewer replicas than the desired number of
replicas, or reduce the partition count below the desired partition count.

**Note**

The automatic scaling progression is based on the instance type's available disk space. The
```
   search.small and search.medium instance types have the same amount of disk space,

```
so both scale to search.large.

You can change your scaling options at any time. If your need for additional capacity is temporary,
you can prescale your domain by setting the scaling options and then revert the changes after your
volume of uploads or queries returns to your domain's steady state. When you make changes, you
need to re-index your domain, which can take some time for the changes to take effect. How long
it takes to re-index depends on the amount of data in your index. You can monitor the domain
status to determine when indexing is completeâthe status changes from PROCESSING to ACTIVE.

#### Choosing Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch

When you set scaling options for a domain, you make a trade-off between cost and performanceâ
changing the desired instance type, replication count, and partition count can significantly impact
the cost of running your domain.

To determine which instance type to select to handle your upload traffic, monitor your upload
performance as you increase the upload rate. If you start seeing a large number of 504 or 507

Choosing Scaling Options API Version 2013-01-01 52


-----

errors before you reach your desired upload rate, select a larger instance type. If you are already
on the largest instance type, you can increase the number of partitions to further increase upload
capacity.

For datasets of less than 1 GB of data or fewer than one million 1 KB documents, a small search
instance should be sufficient. To upload data sets between 1 GB and 8 GB, we recommend setting

the desired instance type to search.large before you begin uploading. For datasets between 8

GB and 16 GB, start with a search.xlarge. For datasets between 16 GB and 32 GB, start with a
```
search.2xlarge. If you have more than 32 GB to upload, select the search.2xlarge instance

```
type and increase the desired partition count to accommodate your data set. Each partition can
[contain up to 32 GB of data. Submit a Service Increase Limit Request if you need more upload](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudsearch-partitions-and-instances)
capacity or have more than 500 GB to index.

To determine how many replicas you need to handle a given query volume, do some testing
using a sample of your expected queries at the rate you need to support. Keep in mind that query
performance depends heavily on the type of queries being processed. In general, searches that
return a large volume of hits and complex structured queries are more resource intensive than
simple text queries that match a small percentage of the documents in your search domain. If you
expect a high volume of complex queries, choose a larger desired instance type and increase the
desired replication count.

#### Configuring Scaling Options through the Amazon CloudSearch Console

**To configure a search domain's scaling options**

Note that changing the desired instance type and replication count can significantly increase the
cost of running your domain.

1. On the Amazon CloudSearch console, choose the name of the domain you want to configure.

2. On the Domain configuration tab, choose Edit next to Scaling options.

3. Select an instance type from the Desired instance type menu.

4. Select the number of replicas you want to use from the Desired replication count menu.

5. If you selected the search.2xlarge instance type, configure the Desired partition
**count. Increase the partition count if you have more data to upload than will fit on a single**
```
  search.2xlarge partition. For more information, see Bulk Uploads.

```
6. Choose Submit.

7. After you finish making changes to your domain configuration, choose Actions, Run indexing
to update and deploy your index to the new instances.

#### Configuring Scaling Options through the AWS CLI

You use the aws cloudsearch update-scaling-parameters command to configure scaling
options for a search domain. For information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the
[AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

**To configure a search domain's scaling options**

- Run the aws cloudsearch update-scaling-parameters command. You can specify the
desired instance type and desired replication count. If you choose the largest instance type

(search.2xlarge), you can also set the desired partition count. For example, the following

command sets the desired instance type to search.xlarge and the desired replication count

to two. You must specify both the --domain-name and --scaling-parameters options.
```
   aws cloudsearch update-scaling-parameters --domain-name movies --scaling-parameters
    DesiredInstanceType=search.xlarge,DesiredReplicationCount=2
   {
     "ScalingParameters": {
       "Status": {
         "PendingDeletion": false, 
         "State": "RequiresIndexDocuments", 
         "CreationDate": "2014-06-25T21:41:21Z", 
         "UpdateVersion": 10, 
         "UpdateDate": "2014-06-25T21:41:21Z"
       }, 
       "Options": {
         "DesiredInstanceType": "search.xlarge", 
         "DesiredReplicationCount": 2
       }
     }
   }      

```
**Important**

When you specify --scaling-parameters, Amazon CloudSearch treats unspecified
options as "reset to default" rather than "leave as-is."

Configuring Scaling Options through the AWS CLI API Version 2013-01-01 54


-----

For example, if you specify --scaling-parameters
```
DesiredInstanceType=search.xlarge in a command and then --scalingparameters DesiredReplicationCount=2 in a subsequent command, Amazon

```
CloudSearch resets DesiredInstanceType to its default value during the second
command.
If you want the change from the first command to persist, you must

specify it again in all subsequent commands: --scaling-parameters
```
DesiredInstanceType=search.xlarge,DesiredReplicationCount=2.

```

For the changes to take effect, you must initiate an index build. You can rebuild the index by calling
```
aws cloudsearch index-documents.

#### Configuring Scaling Options through the AWS SDK

```
The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including UpdateScalingParameters.

### Configuring Availability Options in Amazon CloudSearch

You can expand an Amazon CloudSearch domain to an additional Availability Zone in the same
region to increase fault tolerance in the event of a service disruption. Availability Zones are
physically separate locations with independent infrastructure engineered to be insulated from

[failures in other Availability Zones. For more information, see Regions and Availability Zones in the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)
Amazon EC2 User Guide.

When you turn on the Multi-AZ option, Amazon CloudSearch provisions and maintains extra
instances for your search domain in a second Availability Zone to ensure high availability. The
maximum number of Availability Zones a domain can be deployed in is two.

Turning on Multi-AZ does not affect a search domain's service endpoints or increase the volume of
data or traffic your search domain can handle. Updates are automatically applied to the instances
in both Availability Zones. Search traffic is distributed across all of the instances and the instances
in either zone are capable of handling the full load in the event of a failure.

Configuring Scaling Options through the AWS SDK API Version 2013-01-01 55


-----

If there's an Availability Zone service disruption or the instances in one zone become degraded,
Amazon CloudSearch routes all traffic to the other Availability Zone. Redundant instances are
restored in a separate Availability Zone without any administrative intervention or disruption in
service.

You expand an existing search domain to a second Availability Zone by turning on the MultiAZ option. Similarly, you can turn off the Multi-AZ option to downgrade the domain to a single
Availability Zone. Turning the Multi-AZ option on or off takes about half an hour.

You can configure a domain's availability options through the Amazon CloudSearch console, using

the aws cloudsearch update-availability-options command, or the AWS SDKs.

**Important**

If your domain is running on a single search instance, enabling the Multi-AZ option adds a
second search instance in a different availability zone, which doubles the cost of running
your domain. Similarly, if your index is split across multiple partitions, a new instance is
deployed in the second Availability Zone for each partition. Additional replicas are added
to ensure that either Availability Zone has enough capacity to handle all of your traffic
âwhen Multi-AZ is enabled, your domain will have at least one replica of each index
partition. If you set the desired number of replicas and enable the Multi-AZ option, Amazon
CloudSearch ensures that you have at least that many replicas available in total across
the two availability zones. You can monitor the number of instances being used for your
domain from the domain dashboard.

When a domain is first created, the domain status will indicate that the domain is currently
being activated and no other information is available. Once your domain's document and search
endpoints are available, the domain status shows the endpoint addresses that you can use to add
data and submit search requests. If you haven't submitted any data for indexing, the number of
searchable documents is zero.

You can view all of the information about your domain through the Amazon CloudSearch console.

When you use the aws cloudsearch describe-domains command or the AWS SDKs, the
domain's ARN is shown within the domain's access policies.

##### Generating SDK for Java Metrics for Amazon CloudSearch

The AWS SDK for Java can generate performance metrics for your Amazon CloudSearch client and
send them to CloudWatch for visualization. For the Java VM arguments that enable this feature,

[see Enabling Metrics for the AWS SDK for Java in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/generating-sdk-metrics.html)

You can use the following code to test metrics generation. The code creates a new CloudWatch
client and performs 2,500 searches. Because the SDK only sends metrics once per minute, long[running clients work best. The code uses the default credential provider chain.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default)
```
 import com.amazonaws.client.builder.AwsClientBuilder;
 import com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.AmazonCloudSearchDomain;
 import com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.AmazonCloudSearchDomainClientBuilder;
 import com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.model.SearchRequest;
 public class Metrics {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
   String search_endpoint = "https://search-domain-id.us west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com";
   String region = "us-west-1";
   AwsClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration endpointConfig = new AwsClientBuilder
     .EndpointConfiguration(search_endpoint, region);
   AmazonCloudSearchDomainClientBuilder builder = AmazonCloudSearchDomainClientBuilder
     .standard()
     .withEndpointConfiguration(endpointConfig);
   AmazonCloudSearchDomain client = builder.build();
   String query;
   SearchRequest request = new SearchRequest();
   com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.model.SearchResult test =
 client.search(request);
   for (int i = 0; i < 2500; i++) {
    query = "test";
    request.setQuery(query);
    test = client.search(request);
    System.out.println(test.toString());
   }

```

 }
}

```

To verify that the SDK is sending metrics to CloudWatch, check the Metrics page of the
CloudWatch console and look for AWSSDK/Java under the Custom Namespaces section. The
metrics might take several minutes to display.

##### Viewing CloudWatch Metrics for an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

The Amazon CloudSearch console graphs the metrics reported to CloudWatch. You can also access
[the metrics through the CloudWatch console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs. For more information, see](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch)
[Viewing, Graphing, and Publishing Metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/working_with_metrics.html)

**To view metrics for a search domain using the Amazon CloudSearch console**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch)

2. Choose Domains from the left navigation pane.

3. Click the name of the domain, and then go to the Monitoring tab.

#### Logging Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API Calls with AWS CloudTrail

Amazon CloudSearch integrates with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of
actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon CloudSearch. CloudTrail captures all
configuration API calls for Amazon CloudSearch as events.

**Note**

CloudTrail only captures calls to the configuration API, such as CreateDomain and
```
   UpdateServiceAccessPolicies, not the document service API nor the search API.

```
The calls captured include calls from the Amazon CloudSearch console, CLI, or SDKs. If you create
a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including
events for Amazon CloudSearch. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent
events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail,
you can determine the request that was made to Amazon CloudSearch, the IP address from which
the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.

-----

[To learn more about CloudTrail, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)

##### Amazon CloudSearch Information in CloudTrail

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in
Amazon CloudSearch, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service
events in Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account.
[For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html)

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Amazon CloudSearch,
create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default,
when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events
from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you
specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the
event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

[â¢ Overview for Creating a Trail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.html)

[â¢ CloudTrail Supported Services and Integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.html#cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics-integrations)

[Multiple Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.html)

All Amazon CloudSearch configuration API actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in
the the section called âConfiguration API Referenceâ.

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The identity
information helps you determine the following:

- Whether the request was made with root or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user

credentials.

- Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user.

- Whether the request was made by another AWS service.

##### Understanding Amazon CloudSearch Log File Entries

A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that
you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single
request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of
the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files aren't an ordered stack trace of the
public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order.

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry that demonstrates the CreateDomain action.
```
 {
  "eventVersion": "1.05",
  "userIdentity": {
   "type": "IAMUser",
   "principalId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",

#### Tracking your Amazon CloudSearch Usage and Charges

The AWS account activity page enables you to track your Amazon CloudSearch usage and charges.

**To get your Amazon CloudSearch usage information**

1. [Go to aws.amazon.com and choose My Account, Billing & Cost Management.](http://aws.amazon.com)

2. Choose Cost & Usage Reports, then choose AWS Usage Report.

3. Choose Amazon CloudSearch from the services dropdown.

4. Specify the information that you want to include in the report, then choose the download
button for the data format that you want to download. Reports can be downloaded in XML or
CSV format.

### Deleting an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

If you are no longer using a search domain, you must delete it to avoid incurring additional usage
fees. You will still be charged for a domain even if it does not contain any documentsâdeleting all
documents does not delete the domain. Deleting a domain deletes the index associated with the
domain and takes the domain's document and search endpoints offline permanently. It can take
some time to completely remove a domain and decommission all of its resources. Small domains
are typically deleted in a short amount of time, while especially large domains may require an

extended amount of time to be deleted. During this process, the domain status is Being Deleted
and your account is not charged.

Tracking your Amazon CloudSearch Usage and Charges API Version 2013-01-01 71


-----

You can delete a domain from the Amazon CloudSearch console, using the aws cloudsearch
```
delete-domain command, or using the AWS SDKs.

```
**Topics**

- Deleting a Domain Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

- Deleting a Domain Using the AWS CLI

- Deleting Amazon CloudSearch Domains Using the AWS SDKs

#### Deleting a Domain Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

You can easily delete a domain from the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

**To delete a domain**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In left Navigation pane, choose Domains.

3. Select the checkbox next to the domain that you want to delete, then choose Delete and
confirm deletion.

#### Deleting a Domain Using the AWS CLI

Run the aws cloudsearch delete-domain command and specify the name of the domain you

want to delete. For example, to delete the movies domain, you specify --domain-name movies.
```
 aws cloudsearch delete-domain --domain-name movies 

```
[For information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)
[User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

#### Deleting Amazon CloudSearch Domains Using the AWS SDKs

The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including DeleteDomain. For more

### Tagging Amazon CloudSearch Domains

Use Amazon CloudSearch tags to attach metadata to your search domains. AWS does not apply any
semantic meaning to your tags; tags are interpreted strictly as character strings. All tags contain
the following elements.

**Tag Element** **Description**

Tag key The tag key is the required name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the
domain to which they are attached. For a list of basic restrictions on tag keys
[and values, see Tag Restrictions.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html)

Tag value The tag value is an optional string value of the tag. Tag values can be null and
do not have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value
pair in a tag set of project/Trinity and cost-center/Trinity. For a list of basic
[restrictions on tag keys and values, see Tag Restrictions.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html)

Each Amazon CloudSearch domain has a tag set, which contains all the tags that are assigned to
that domain. AWS does not automatically set any tags on Amazon CloudSearch domains. A tag set
can contain as many as ten tags, or it can be empty. If you add a tag to an Amazon CloudSearch
domain that has the same key as an existing tag for a resource, the new value overwrites the old
value.

You can use a tag key to define a category, and the tag value can be a item in that category.

For example, you could define a tag key of project and a tag value of Salix indicating
that the domain is assigned to the Salix project. You could also use tags to designate

domains for test or production environments by using keys such as environment=test and
```
environment=production. We recommend that you use a consistent set of tag keys to make it

```
easier to track metadata associated with your search domains.

You also can use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure and to track
costs by grouping expenses for similarly tagged resources. To do this, sign up to get your AWS
account bill with tag key values included. Then, organize your billing information according to
resources with the same tag key values to see the cost of combined resources. For example, you
can tag several Amazon CloudSearch domains with key-value pairs, and then organize your billing
information to see the total cost for each domain across several services. For more information, see
[Cost Allocation and Tagging in the AWS Billing and Cost Management documentation.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html)

|Tag Element|Description|
|---|---|
|Tag key|The tag key is the required name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the domain to which they are attached. For a list of basic restrictions on tag keys and values, see Tag Restrictions.|
|Tag value|The tag value is an optional string value of the tag. Tag values can be null and do not have to be unique in a tag set.

**Note**

Tags are cached for authorization purposes. Because of this, additions and updates to tags
on Amazon CloudSearch domains might take several minutes before they are available.


#### Working with Tags (Console)

Use the following procedure to create a resource tag with the Amazon CloudSearch console.

**To create a tag**

1. Go to the Amazon CloudSearch console and choose the name of your domain to open its
configuration panel.

2. Go to the Tags tab and choose Manage.

3. Enter a tag key and optional value, then choose Submit.

## Controlling How Data is Indexed in Amazon CloudSearch

You control how your data is indexed by configuring indexing options and analysis schemes
for your domain. Indexing options control how your data is mapped to index fields and what
information you can search and retrieve from the index. The data you upload must contain the
same fields configured in your domain's indexing options, and the field values must be compatible

with the configured field types. Analysis schemes control how text and text-array fields are
processed during indexing by defining language-specific stemming, stopword, and synonym
options.

**Topics**

- Preparing Your Data for Amazon CloudSearch

- Configuring Index Fields for an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

- Using Dynamic Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

- Configuring Text Analysis Schemes for Amazon CloudSearch

- Text Processing in Amazon CloudSearch

### Preparing Your Data for Amazon CloudSearch

You need to format your data in JSON or XML before you can upload it to your search domain
for indexing. Each item that you want to be able to receive as a search result is represented as a
document. Every document has a unique document ID and one or more fields that contain the data
that you want to search and return in results. These document fields are used to populate the index
fields you configure for your domain. For more information, see configure indexing options.

Creating Document Batches describes how to format your data. For a detailed description of the
Amazon CloudSearch JSON and XML schemas, see the Document Service API.

**Topics**

- Mapping Document Data to Index Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

- Creating Document Batches in Amazon CloudSearch

Preparing Your Data API Version 2013-01-01 75


-----

#### Mapping Document Data to Index Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

To populate the fields in your index, Amazon CloudSearch reads the data from the corresponding
document fields. Every field specified in your document data must be configured in your indexing
options. Documents can contain a subset of the fields configured for the domainâevery document
does not have to contain all fields. In addition, you can populate additional fields in your index
by copying the data from one field to another. This enables you to use the same source data in

different ways by configuring different options for the fields.

An array field such as text-array can contain up to 1000 values. At search time, the document is
returned as a hit if any of those values match the search query.

#### Creating Document Batches in Amazon CloudSearch

**Important**

Before uploading data to an Amazon CloudSearch domain, follow these guidelines:

   - Group documents into batches before you upload them. Continuously uploading batches

that consist of only one document has a huge, negative impact on the speed at which
Amazon CloudSearch can process your updates. Instead, create batches that are as
close to the limit as possible and upload them less frequently. For more information on
maximum batch size and upload frequency, see Limits.

   - A domain's document and search endpoints remain the same for the life of the domain.

You should cache the endpoints rather than retrieving them before every upload or

search request. Querying the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service by calling aws
```
    cloudsearch describe-domains or DescribeDomains before every request will

```
likely result in your requests being throttled.

You create document batches to describe the data that you want to make searchable. When you
send document batches to a domain, the data is indexed automatically according to the domain's
indexing options. The Amazon CloudSearch console can automatically generate document batches
from a variety of source documents.

A document batch is a collection of add and delete operations that represent the documents you
want to add, update, or delete from your domain. Batches can be described in either JSON or XML.
See Limits for maximum batch size and document size.

Mapping Document Data to Index Fields API Version 2013-01-01 76


-----

To get the best possible upload performance, group add and delete operations in batches that
are close to the maximum batch size. Submitting a large volume of single-document batches to
the document service can increase the time it takes for your changes to become visible in search
results. If you have a large amount of data to upload, you can send batches in parallel. The number
of simultaneous uploaders you can use depends on the search instance type. You can prescale for
bulk uploads by setting the desired instance type option for your domain. For more information,
see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

For each document in a batch, you must specify:

- The operation you want to perform: add or delete.

- A unique ID for the document. A document ID can contain any letter or number and the

following characters: _ - = # ; : / ? @ &. Document IDs must be at least 1 and no more than 128
characters long.

- A name-value pair for each document field. To specify the value for a latlon field, you specify

the latitude and longitude as a comma-separated list; for example, "location_field":
```
 "35.628611,-120.694152". When specifying documents in JSON, the value for a field cannot

```
be null. (You can, however, omit the field entirely.)

For example, the following JSON batch adds one document and deletes one document:
```
 [
 {"type": "add",
  "id":  "tt0484562",
  "fields": {
   "title": "The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising",
   "directors": ["Cunningham, David L."],
   "genres": ["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Thriller"],
   "actors": ["McShane, Ian","Eccleston, Christopher","Conroy, Frances",
        "Crewson, Wendy","Ludwig, Alexander","Cosmo, James",
        "Warner, Amelia","Hickey, John Benjamin","Piddock, Jim",
        "Lockhart, Emma"]
  }
 },
 {"type": "delete",
  "id":  "tt0484575"
 }
 ]

```
Creating Document Batches API Version 2013-01-01 77


-----

The same batch formatted in XML looks like this:
```
 <batch>
 <add id="tt0484562">
  <field name="title">The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising</field>
  <field name="directors">Cunningham, David L.</field>
  <field name="genres">Adventure</field>
  <field name="genres">Drama</field>
  <field name="genres">Fantasy</field>
  <field name="genres">Thriller</field>
  <field name="actors">McShane, Ian</field>
  <field name="actors">Eccleston, Christopher</field>
  <field name="actors">Conroy, Frances</field>
  <field name="actors">Ludwig, Alexander</field>
  <field name="actors">Crewson, Wendy</field>
  <field name="actors">Warner, Amelia</field>
  <field name="actors">Cosmo, James</field>
  <field name="actors">Hickey, John Benjamin</field>
  <field name="actors">Piddock, Jim</field>
  <field name="actors">Lockhart, Emma</field>
 </add>
 <delete id="tt0484575" />
 </batch>

```
Amazon CloudSearch accepts a batch only if all documents in it are valid. You can verify the validity

of your JSON or XML data using tools such as xmllint and jsonlint.

Both JSON and XML batches can only contain UTF-8 characters that are valid in XML. Valid
characters are the control characters tab (0009), carriage return (000D), and line feed (000A), and

the legal characters of Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646. FFFE, FFFF, and the surrogate blocks D800â
[DBFF and DC00âDFFF are invalid and will cause errors. (For more information, see Extensible](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets)
[Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition).) You can use the following regular expression to match](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets)

invalid characters so you can remove them: /[^\u0009\u000a\u000d\u0020-\uD7FF\uE000```
\uFFFD]/ .

```
When formatting your data in JSON, quotes (") and backslashes (\) within field values must be
escaped with a backslash. For example:
```
 "title":"Where the Wild Things Are"
 "isbn":"0-06-025492-0"
 "image":"images\\covers\\Where_The_Wild_Things_Are_(book)_cover.jpg"

```
Creating Document Batches API Version 2013-01-01 78


-----

```
"comment":"Sendak's \"Where the Wild Things Are\" is a children's classic."

```

When formatting your data in XML, ampersands (&) and less-than symbols (<) within field values

need to be represented with the corresponding entity references (&amp; and &lt;).

For example:
```
 <field name="title">Little Cow &amp; the Turtle</field>
 <field name="isbn">0-84466-4774</field>
 <field name="image">images\covers\Little_Cow_&amp;_the_Turtle.jpg</field>
 <field name="comment">&lt;insert comment></field>

```
If you have large blocks of user-generated content, you might want to wrap the entire field in a
CDATA section, rather than replacing every occurrence with the entity reference. For example:
```
 <field name="comment"><![CDATA[Monsters & mayhem--what's not to like! ]]>

##### Adding and Updating Documents in Amazon CloudSearch

```
An add operation specifies either a new document that you want to add to the index or an existing
document that you want to update.

When you add or update a document, you specify the document's ID and all of the fields the
document contains. You don't have to specify every configured field for every documentâ
documents can contain a subset of the configured fields. However, every field in the document
must correspond to a field configured for the domain.

**To add a document to a search domain**

1. Specify an add operation that contains the ID of the document you want to add and each
of the fields that you want to be able to search or return in results. If the document already
exists, the add operation will replace it. (You cannot update selected fields, the document
is overwritten with the new version.) For example, the following operation adds document
tt0484562:
```
   { "type": "add",
    "id":  "tt0484562",
    "fields": {
     "title": "The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising",
     "directors": ["Cunningham, David L."],

2. Include the add operation in a document batch and upload the batch to your domain. You can
upload data through the Amazon CloudSearch console or by posting a request directly to the
domain's document service endpoint. For more information, see upload documents.

##### Deleting Documents in Amazon CloudSearch

A delete operation specifies a document that you want to remove from a domain's index. Once a

document is deleted, it will no longer be searchable or returned in results.

When posting updates to delete documents, you have to specify each document that you want to
delete.

If your domain has scaled up to accommodate your index size and you delete a large number of
documents, the domain scales down the next time the full index is rebuilt. Although the index
is automatically rebuilt periodically, to scale down as quickly as possible you can explicitly run
indexing when you are done deleting documents.

**Note**

To delete documents, you upload document batches that contain delete operations. You
are billed for the total number of document batches uploaded to your search domain,
including batches that contain delete operations. For more information about Amazon
[CloudSearch pricing, see aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/pricing/.](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/pricing/)

**To delete a document from a search domain**

1. Specify a delete operation that contains the ID of the document you want to remove. For

example, the following operation would remove document tt0484575:
```
   {
    "type": "delete",

```

-----

```
 "id": "tt0484575"
}

```

2. Include the delete operation in a document batch and upload the batch to your domain. You
can upload batches through the Amazon CloudSearch console or by posting a request directly

to the domain's document service endpoint. For more information, see upload documents.

3. The delete operation removes documents from your indexâthey won't appear in search
resultsâbut to delete them entirely from Amazon CloudSearch, you must also rebuild your
index.

##### Processing Your Source Data for Amazon CloudSearch

To upload data for indexing, you need to format your data in either JSON or XML. The Amazon
CloudSearch console provide a way to automatically generate properly formatted JSON or XML

from several common file types: CSV, text, and HTML. You can also process batches formatted for
the Amazon CloudSearch 2011-02-01 API to convert them to the 2013-01-01 format.

For most file types, each source file is represented as a separate document in the generated JSON
or XML. If metadata is available for the file, the metadata is mapped to corresponding document
fieldsâthe fields generated from the document metadata vary depending on the file type. The
contents of the source file are parsed into a single text field. If the file contains more than 1 MB of
data, the data mapped to the text field is truncated so that the document does not exceed 1 MB.

CSV files are handled differently. When processing a CSV file, Amazon CloudSearch uses the
contents of the first row to define the document fields, and creates a separate document for each
following row. If there is a column header called docid, the values in that column are used as the
document IDs. If necessary, the docid values are normalized to conform to the allowed character
set. A document ID can contain any letter or number and the following characters: _ - = # ; : / ? @
&. If there is no docid column, a unique ID is generated for each document based on the filename
and row number.

If you upload multiple types of files, CSV files are parsed row-by-row, and non-CSV files are treated
as individual documents.

**Note**

Currently, only CSV files are parsed to automatically extract custom field data and generate
multiple documents.

Creating Document Batches API Version 2013-01-01 81


-----

You can also process data stored in DynamoDB. Amazon CloudSearch represents each item read
from the table as a separate document.

**Processing Source Data Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console**

When you upload source documents or DynamoDB items through the Amazon CloudSearch
console, they are automatically converted to the Amazon CloudSearch JSON format. You can use
the console to upload up to 5 MB of data at a time. If you choose, you can download the generated
JSON file. For more information about uploading data through the console, see upload documents
and Uploading DynamoDB Data.

### Configuring Index Fields for an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

Each document that you add to your search domain has a collection of fields that contain the data

that can be searched or returned. Every document must have a unique document ID and at least
one field.

In your domain configuration, you define an index field for each of the fields that occur in your
documents. You cannot upload documents that contain unrecognized fields. However, every
document does not have to contain all fieldsâdocuments can contain a subset of the fields
configured for the domain.

**Topics**

- Configuring Individual Index Fields with the AWS CLI

- Configuring Index Fields Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

- Configuring Amazon CloudSearch Index Fields Using the AWS SDKs

Amazon CloudSearch supports the following index field types:

- dateâcontains a timestamp. Dates and times are specified in UTC (Coordinated Universal

[Time) according to IETF RFC3339: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ. In UTC, for example, 5:00 PM](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)

August 23, 1970 is: 1970-08-23T17:00:00Z. Note that you can also specify fractional seconds

when specifying times in UTC. For example, 1967-01-31T23:20:50.650Z.

- date-arrayâa date field that can contain multiple values.

- doubleâcontains a double-precision 64-bit floating point value.

- double-arrayâa double field that can contain multiple values.

Configuring Index Fields API Version 2013-01-01 82


-----

- intâcontains a 64-bit signed integer value.

- int-arrayâan integer field that can contain multiple values.

- latlonâcontains a location stored as a latitude and longitude value pair (lat, lon).

- literalâcontains an identifier or other data that you want to be able to match exactly. Literal

fields are case-sensitive.

- literal-arrayâa literal field that can contain multiple values.

- textâcontains arbitrary alphanumeric data.

- text-arrayâa text field that can contain multiple values.

Regular index field names must begin with a letter and be at least 3 and no more than 64
characters long. The allowed characters are: a-z (lower-case letters), 0-9, and _ (underscore). The
name score is reserved and cannot be specified as a field name. All field and expression names
must be unique.

Dynamic field names must either begin or end with a wildcard (*). The string before or after the
wildcard can contain the same set of characters as a regular index field. For more information
about dynamic fields, see the section called âUsing Dynamic Fieldsâ.

The options you can configure for a field vary according to the field type:

- HighlightEnabledâYou can get highlighting information for the search hits in any
```
 HighlightEnabled text field. Valid for: text, text-array.

```
- FacetEnabledâYou can get facet information for any FacetEnabled field. Text fields cannot

be used for faceting. Valid for: int, int-array, date, date-array, double, double-array,
```
 latlon, literal, literal-array.

```
- ReturnEnabledâYou can retrieve the value of any ReturnEnabled field with your search

results. Note that this increases the size of your index, which can increase the cost of running
your domain. When possible, it's best to retrieve large amounts of data from an external source,
rather than embedding it in your index. Since it can take some time to apply document updates
across the domain, critical data such as pricing information should be retrieved from an external

source using the returned document IDs. Valid for: int, int-array, date, date-array,
```
 double, double-array, latlon, literal, literal-array, text, text-array.

```
- SearchEnabledâYou can search the contents of any SearchEnabled field. Text fields are

always searchable. Valid for: int, int-array, date, date-array, double, double-array,
```
 latlon, literal, literal-array, text, text-array.

```
Configuring Index Fields API Version 2013-01-01 83


-----

- SortEnabledâYou can sort the search results alphabetically or numerically using any
```
 SortEnabled field. Array-type fields cannot be SortEnabled. Only sort enabled numeric fields

```
can be used in expressions. Valid for: int, date, latlon, double, literal, text.

You can also specify a default value and a source for any field. Specifying a default value can be
important if you are using a numeric field in an expression and that field is not present in every
document. Specifying a source copies data from one field to another, enabling you to use the same
source data in different ways by configuring different options for the fields. You can use a wildcard
(*) when specifying the source name to copy data from all fields that match the specified pattern.

When you add fields or modify existing fields, you must explicitly issue a request to re-index your
data when you are done making configuration changes. For more information, see rebuild the
index.

**Important**

If you change the type of a field and have documents in your index that contain data
that is incompatible with the new field type, all fields being processed are put in the
```
   FailedToValidate state when you run indexing and the indexing operation fails. Rolling

```
back the incompatible configuration change will enable you to successfully rebuild your
index. If the change is necessary, you must update or remove the incompatible documents
from your index to use the new configuration.

#### Configuring Individual Index Fields with the AWS CLI

You use the aws cloudsearch define-index-field command to configure individual index
fields for a search domain. For information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the
[AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

**To add an index field to your domain**

- Run the aws cloudsearch define-index-field command and specify the name of the

new field with the --name option, and the field type with the --type option. The following

example adds an int field called year to the movies domain.

Configuring Individual Index Fields API Version 2013-01-01 84


-----

**Example**
```
   aws cloudsearch define-index-field --domain-name movies --name year --type int
   {
     "IndexField": {
       "Status": {
         "PendingDeletion": false, 
         "State": "RequiresIndexDocuments", 
         "CreationDate": "2014-06-25T23:03:06Z", 
         "UpdateVersion": 15, 
         "UpdateDate": "2014-06-25T23:03:06Z"
       }, 
       "Options": {
         "IndexFieldType": "int", 
         "IndexFieldName": "year"
       }
     }
   }

```
**Note**

When you add fields or modify existing fields, you must explicitly issue a request to reindex your data when you are done making configuration changes. For more information,
see rebuild the index.

#### Configuring Index Fields Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

You can easily configure individual index fields for your domain through the Indexing Options
panel in the Amazon CloudSearch console. Configuring index fields in the console requires the
```
DefineIndexFields action, which the AWS CLI doesn't support.

##### Configuring Individual Fields Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

```
**To configure a new index field**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In the left navigation pane, choose Domains.

-----

3. Click the name of the domain that you want to configure, then go to the Indexing options tab.

4. Choose New index field to add a field specification to the list.

5. Specify a unique name for the field and select the field type. Field names must begin with a
letter and be at least 3 and no more than 64 characters long. The allowed characters are: a-z

(lower-case letters), 0-9, and _ (underscore). The name score is reserved and cannot be used as
a field name.

6. Select the query details that you want to enable for the field. For more information, see
configure indexing options.

7. Select the analysis scheme to use for each text field. The analysis scheme specifies the
language-specific text processing options that are used during indexing. By default, text fields

use the _en_default_ analysis scheme. For more information, see Configuring Analysis
Schemes.

8. Specify a default value for the field (optional). This value is used when no value is specified for
the field in the document data.

9. Optionally, add additional fields in Source field.

10. Choose Submit.

**Note**

When you add fields or modify existing fields, you must explicitly issue a request to reindex your data when you are done making configuration changes. For more information,
see rebuild the index.

#### Configuring Amazon CloudSearch Index Fields Using the AWS SDKs

The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including DefineIndexField. For more
[information about installing and using the AWS SDKs, see AWS Software Development Kits.](http://aws.amazon.com/code)

### Using Dynamic Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

Dynamic fields provide a way to index documents without knowing in advance exactly what fields
they contain. For example, consider the case where you want to search a set of products. You might

Configuring Index Fields Using the AWS SDK API Version 2013-01-01 86


-----

not know the names of all of the possible product attributes across all product categories, but you

can structure your data so that all text-based attributes are stored in fields that end in _t, and all

integer values are stored in fields that end in _i. With dynamic fields, you can map the attribute
fields to the appropriate field type without having to configure a field for every possible attribute.

This reduces the amount of configuration that you need to do up front, and eliminates the need
to modify your domain configuration every time a product with a new attribute is added. You can
also use dynamic fields to essentially ignore new fields by mapping them to a field that is not
searchable or returnable.

**Topics**

- Configuring Dynamic Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

- Using a Dynamic Field to Ignore Unrecognized Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

- Searching Dynamic Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

#### Configuring Dynamic Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

You designate a field as a dynamic field by specifying a wildcard (*) as the first, last, or only
character in the field name. Dynamic field names must either begin or end with a wildcard (*).
Multiple wildcards and wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

A dynamic field's name defines a pattern. The wildcard matches zero or more arbitrary characters.
Any unrecognized fields that match that pattern are configured with the dynamic field's indexing
options. Regular index fields take precedence over dynamic fields. If a document field name
matches both a regular index field and a dynamic field pattern, it is mapped to the regular index
field.

**Note**

The options you can configure for dynamic fields are the same as for static fields. Similarly,
document field names that match a dynamic field must meet all the same criteria as static
field names.

For example, if you establish the naming convention that _i is appended to the name of any new
```
int field, you can define a dynamic field with the pattern *_i that sets the field type to int and

```
configures a set of predefined indexing options for new int fields. When you add a field such as
```
review_rating_i, it's configured according to the *_i options and indexed automatically.

```
Configuring Dynamic Fields API Version 2013-01-01 87


-----

If a document field matches more than one dynamic field pattern, the longest matching pattern is
used. If the patterns are the same length, the dynamic field that occurs first when the field names
are sorted alphabetically is used.

You can define * as a dynamic field to match any fields that don't map to an explicitly defined
field or a longer dynamic field pattern. This is useful if you want to simply ignore unrecognized
fields. For more information, see Using a Dynamic Field to Ignore Unrecognized Fields in Amazon

CloudSearch.

Dynamic fields count toward the total number of fields defined for a domain. A domain can have
a maximum of 200 field definitions, which includes dynamic fields. However, the pattern defined
by a single dynamic field typically matches multiple document fields, so the total number of
fields in your index can exceed 200. For more information, see Limits. When using dynamic fields,
keep in mind that significantly increasing the number of fields in your index can impact query
performance.

Adding new fields to your domain configuration can affect how fields that were generated
dynamically are validated during indexing. If the validation fails, indexing will fail. For example,

if you define a dynamic field called *_new and upload documents that contain a field called
```
rating_new, the rating_new field will be added to your index. If you then explicitly configure a

```
field called rating_new, that new field configuration will be used to validate the contents of your

document's rating_new field when you run indexing. If *_new is configured as a text field and

you configure rating_new as an int field, validation will fail if the existing rating_new fields
contain non-integer data.

For more information about configuring index fields, see configure indexing options.

#### Using a Dynamic Field to Ignore Unrecognized Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

Amazon CloudSearch requires that you configure an index field for every field that occurs in the
documents you are indexing. In some cases, however, you want to index a particular set of fields
and simply ignore everything else. You can use dynamic fields to ignore all unrecognized fields by
defining a literal field called * and disabling all indexing options for the field. Any unrecognized
fields will inherit those options and will be added to your domain; however, the field contents
won't be searchable or returnable, so they'll have minimal impact on the size of your index. (They
do, however, count toward the total number of fields configured for the domain.) Similarly, you can

selectively ignore fields that match a particular pattern, such as *_n.

Ignoring Unrecognized Document Fields API Version 2013-01-01 88


-----

**To ignore unrecognized fields**

1. Configure the fields that you want to index, search, or return in the results.

2. Add a dynamic field that matches any other fields that are found in the documents and
disables all indexing options for them:

   - Specify * as the name of the field, with no prefix or suffix string. (You can also specify a

more specific pattern to selectively disable fields.)

  - Set the field type to literal and disable the search, facet, and return options. Note

that the maximum size of a literal field is 4096 Unicode code points.

Because longer dynamic field patterns are matched first, you can still use dynamic fields to
configure options for fields that you want to use. Any fields that don't map to a regular index field
or a longer dynamic field will match the * pattern.

**Note**

When you create a dynamic field with the name *, it means that your index can potentially
contain any valid field name. This also means that you can reference any valid field name in
your search requests, whether or not it actually exists in your index.

#### Searching Dynamic Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

You can reference dynamically generated fields by name in your search requests and expressions,

just like any other field. For example, to search the dynamically generated field color_t for the

color red, you use the structured query parser:
```
 q=color_t:âredâ&q.parser=structured

```
If you've defined a catch-all dynamic field (*) to map any fields that don't match regular fields or
more specific dynamic field patterns, you can specify any valid field name in your search requests,
whether or not the field actually exists in your index.

Wildcards are not supported within field names, so you cannot reference the dynamic field itself.

For example, specifying q=*_t:âredâ would return an error.

Searching Dynamic Fields API Version 2013-01-01 89


-----

The options a dynamically generated field inherits from the dynamic field configuration control
how you can use the field in your search requests, for example, whether you can search it, get
facets or highlights, use it for sorting, or return in it results. Note that dynamically generated fields
must be searched explicitlyâdynamic fields are NOT included in the fields that are searched by
default when you use the simple query parser or do not specify a field when searching with the
structured query parser.

You can specify dynamic fields as sources for other fields if the target field is an array. A field's
source attribute supports wildcards, which enables you to specify a pattern that matches a group

of dynamic fields. For example, to search all fields generated from the *_t dynamic field, you

could create a field called all_t_fields and set its source attribute to *_t. This copies the

contents of all fields whose names end in _t into all_t_fields. Note, however, that searching
this field will search all fields that match the pattern, not only dynamically generated fields.

For more information about constructing and submitting search requests, see Searching Your Data
with Amazon CloudSearch.

### Configuring Text Analysis Schemes for Amazon CloudSearch

Amazon CloudSearch enables you to configure a language-specific analysis scheme for each text

and text-array field. An analysis scheme controls how the contents of the field are processed
during indexing. Although the defaults for each language work well in many cases, fine-tuning the
analysis options enables you to optimize the search results based on your knowledge of the data
you are searching. For a list of supported languages, see Supported Languages.

An analysis scheme specifies the language of the text to be processed and the following analysis
options:

- Algorithmic stemmingâspecifies the level of algorithmic stemming to perform. The available

stemming levels vary depending on the language.

- Japanese Tokenization Dictionaryâspecifies overrides of the algorithmic tokenization when

processing Japanese. The dictionary specifies how particular sets of characters should be
grouped into words.

- Stemming dictionaryâspecifies overrides for the results of the algorithmic stemming. The

dictionary maps specific related words to a common root word or stem.

- Stopwordsâspecifies words that should be ignored during indexing and searching.

- Synonymsâspecifies words that have the same meaning as words that occur in your data and

should produce the same search results.

Configuring Analysis Schemes API Version 2013-01-01 90


-----

During text processing, field values and search terms are converted to lowercase (case-folded),
so stopwords, stems, and synonyms are not case-sensitive. For more information about how
Amazon CloudSearch processes text during indexing and when handling search requests, see Text
Processing in Amazon CloudSearch.

You must specify a language for each analysis scheme and configure an analysis scheme for each
```
text and text-array field. When you configure fields through the Amazon CloudSearch console,

```
the analysis scheme defaults to the _en_default_ analysis scheme. If you do not specify analysis
options for an analysis scheme, Amazon CloudSearch uses the default options for the specified
language. For information about the defaults for each language, see Language Specific Settings.

The easiest way to define analysis schemes is through the Analysis Schemes page in the Amazon
CloudSearch console. You must apply an analysis scheme to a field for it to take effect. You can
apply an analysis scheme to a field from the Indexing Options page. You can also define analysis
schemes and configure an analysis scheme for each field through the command line tools and AWS

SDKs.

When you apply a new analysis scheme to an index field or modify an analysis scheme that's in use,
you must explicitly rebuild the index for the changes to be reflected in search results.

#### Stemming in Amazon CloudSearch

Stemming is the process of mapping related words to a common stem. A stem is typically the root
or base word from which variants are derived. For example, run is the stem of running and ran.
Stemming is performed during indexing as well as at query time. Stemming reduces the number of
terms that are included in the index, and facilitates matches when the search term is a variant of

Stemming API Version 2013-01-01 91


-----

a term that occurs in the content being searched. For example, if you map the term running to the
stem run and then search for running, the request matches documents that contain run as well as
_running._

Amazon CloudSearch supports both algorithmic stemming and explicit stemming dictionaries. You

configure algorithmic stemming by specifying the level of stemming that you want to use. The
available levels of algorithmic stemming vary depending on the language:

- noneâdisable algorithmic stemming

- minimalâperform basic stemming by removing plural suffixes

- lightâtarget the most common noun/adjective inflections and derived suffixes

- fullâaggressively stem inflections and suffixes

In addition to controlling the degree of algorithmic stemming that's performed, you can specify
a stemming dictionary that maps specific related words to a common stem. You specify the
dictionary as a JSON object that contains a collection of string:value pairs that map a term to

its stem, for example, {"term1": "stem1", "term2": "stem2", "term3": "stem3"}.
The stemming dictionary is applied in addition to any algorithmic stemming. This enables you
to override the results of the algorithmic stemming to correct specific cases of overstemming or
understemming. The maximum size of a stemming dictionary is 500 KB. Stemming dictionary
entries must be lowercase.

You use the StemmingDictionary key to define a custom stemming dictionary in an analysis
scheme. Because you pass the dictionary to Amazon CloudSearch as a string, you must escape all
double quotes within the string. For example, the following analysis scheme defines stems for
_running and jumping:_
```
 {
   "AnalysisSchemeName": "myscheme",
   "AnalysisSchemeLanguage": "en",
   "AnalysisOptions": {
     "AlgorithmicStemming": "light",
      "StemmingDictionary": "{\"running\": \"run\",\"jumping\": \"jump\"}"
   }
 }

```
If you do not specify the level of algorithmic stemming or a stemming dictionary in your analysis
scheme, Amazon CloudSearch uses the default algorithmic stemming level for the specified

Stemming API Version 2013-01-01 92


-----

language. While stemming can help users find relevant documents that might otherwise be
excluded from the search results, overstemming can result in too many matches with questionable
relevance. The default level of algorithmic stemming configured for each language works well
for most use cases. In general, it's best to start with the default and then make adjustments to
optimize the relevance of the search results for your use case. For information about the defaults
for each language, see Language Specific Settings.

#### Stopwords in Amazon CloudSearch

Stopwords are words that should typically be ignored both during indexing and at search time
because they are either insignificant or so common that including them would result in a massive
number of matches.

During indexing, Amazon CloudSearch uses the stopword dictionary when it processes text

and text-array fields. In most cases, stopwords are not included in the index. The stopword
dictionary is also used to filter search requests.

A stopwords dictionary is a JSON array of terms, for example, ["a", "an", "the", "of"]. The
stopwords dictionary must explicitly list each word that you want to ignore. Wildcards and regular
expressions are not supported.

You use the Stopwords key to define a custom stopwords dictionary in an analysis scheme.
Because you pass the dictionary to Amazon CloudSearch as a string, you must escape all double
quotes within the string. For example, the following analysis scheme configures the stopwords a,
_an, and the:_
```
 {
   "AnalysisSchemeName": "myscheme",
   "AnalysisSchemeLanguage": "en",
   "AnalysisOptions": {
      "Stopwords": "[\"a\",\"an\",\"the\"]"
   }
 }

```
If you do not specify a stopwords dictionary in your analysis scheme, Amazon CloudSearch uses
the default stopword dictionary for the specified language. The default stopwords configured for
each language work well for most use cases. In general, it's best to start with the default and then
make adjustments to optimize the relevance of the search results for your use case. For information
about the defaults for each language, see Language Specific Settings.

#### Synonyms in Amazon CloudSearch

You can configure synonyms for terms that appear in the data that you are searching. That

way, if a user searches for the synonym rather than the indexed term, the results will include
documents that contain the indexed term. For example, you might define custom synonyms to do
the following:

- Map common misspellings to the correct spelling

- Define equivalent terms, such as film and movie

- Map a general term to a more specific one, such as fish and barracuda

- Map multiple words to a single word or vice versa, such as tool box and toolbox

When you define a synonym, the synonym is added to the index everywhere the base token occurs.

For example, if you define fish as a synonym of barracuda, the term fish is added to every

document that contains the term barracuda. Adding a large number of synonyms can increase
the size of the index as well as query latencyâsynonyms increase the number of matches and the
more matches, the longer it takes to process the results.

The synonym dictionary is used during indexing to configure mappings for terms that occur in text
fields. No synonym processing is done on search requests. By default, Amazon CloudSearch does
not define any synonyms.

You can specify synonyms in two ways:

- As a conflation group where each term in the group is considered a synonym of every other term

in the group.

- As an alias for a specific term. An alias is considered a synonym of the specified term, but the

term is not considered a synonym of the alias.

A synonym dictionary is specified as a JSON object that defines the synonym groups and aliases.

The groups value is an array of arrays, where each sub-array is a conflation group. The aliases
value is an object that contains a collection of string:value pairs where the string specifies a term
and the array of values specifies each of the synonyms for that term. The following example
includes both conflation groups and aliases:
```
 {
   "groups": [["1st", "first", "one"], ["2nd", "second", "two"]],

```
Synonyms API Version 2013-01-01 94


-----

```
  "aliases": { "youth": ["child", "kid", "boy", "girl"], 
         "adult": ["men", "women"] }
}

```

Both groups and aliases support multiword synonyms. In the following example, multiword
synonyms are used in a conflation group as well as an alias:
```
 {
   "groups": [["tool box", "toolbox"], ["band saw", "bandsaw"]],
   "aliases": { "workbench": ["work bench"]}
 }

```
You use the Synonyms key to define a custom synonym dictionary in an analysis scheme. Because
you pass the dictionary to Amazon CloudSearch as a string, you must escape all double quotes
within the string. For example, the following analysis scheme configures aliases for the term youth:
```
 {
   "AnalysisSchemeName": "myscheme",
   "AnalysisSchemeLanguage": "en",
   "AnalysisOptions": {
     "Synonyms": "{\"aliases\": {\"youth\": [\"child\",\"kid\"]}}"
   }
 }

#### Configuring Analysis Schemes Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

```
You can define analysis schemes from the Analysis Schemes pane in the Amazon CloudSearch
console.

**To define an analysis scheme**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. From the left nagivation pane, choose Domains.

3. Choose the name of your domain to open its configuration.

4. Go to the Advanced search options tab.

5. In the Analysis schemes pane, choose Add analysis scheme.

6. Specify a name for the analysis scheme and select a language.

-----

7. Choose Next.

8. In the next three steps, configure the scheme's text stopword, stemming, and synonym
options. You can configure individual stopwords, stems, and synonyms, or edit the displayed

dictionaries directly. The dictionaries are formatted in JSON. Stopwords are specified as an

array of strings. Stems are specified as an object that contains one or more key:value pairs.
Synonym aliases are also specified as a JSON object with one or move key:value pairs, where
the alias values are specified as an array of strings. A synonym group is specified as a JSON
array. (The synonym dictionary is an array of arrays.)

If you selected Japanese as the language, you also have the option of specifying a custom
tokenization dictionary that overrides the default tokenization of specific phrases. For more
information, see Customizing Japanese Tokenization.

9. On the summary page, review the analysis scheme configuration and choose Save.

**Important**

To use an analysis scheme, you must apply it to one or more text or text-array fields
and rebuild the index. You can configure a field's analysis scheme from the Indexing
**options tab. To rebuild your index, choose Actions, Run indexing.**

#### Configuring Analysis Schemes Using the AWS CLI

You use the aws cloudsearch define-analysis-scheme command to define languagespecific text processing options, including stemming options, stopwords, and synonyms. For
[information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)
[User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

You specify an analysis scheme as part of the configuration of each text or text-array field. For
more information, see configure indexing options.

**To define an analysis scheme**

- Run the aws cloudsearch define-analysis-scheme command and specify the -```
  analysis-scheme option and a JSON object that contains your analysis options. The

```
analysis scheme must be valid JSON. The analysis option key and value pairs must be enclosed
in quotes, and all quotes within the option values must be escaped with a backslash. For

[the format of the analysis options, see define-analysis-scheme in the AWS CLI Command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudsearch/define-analysis-scheme.html)
Reference. See Configuring Analysis Schemes for more information about specifying
stemming, stopword, and synonym options.

If you specify Japanese (ja) as the language, you also have the option of specifying a custom
tokenization dictionary that overrides the default tokenization of specific phrases. For more
information, see Customizing Japanese Tokenization.

**Tip**

The easiest way to configure an analysis scheme with the AWS CLI is to store the

analysis scheme in a text file and specify that file as the --analysis-scheme value.
This enables you to format the scheme so that it's easier to read. For example, the

following scheme defines an English analysis scheme called myscheme that uses light
algorithmic stemming and configures two stopwords:
```
      {
        "AnalysisSchemeName": "myscheme",
        "AnalysisSchemeLanguage": "en",
        "AnalysisOptions": {
          "AlgorithmicStemming": "light",
          "Stopwords": "[\"a\", \"the\"]"   
        }
      }

```
If you save this scheme in a text file called myscheme.txt, you can pass the file in as

the value of the --analysis-scheme parameter:
```
      aws cloudsearch define-analysis-scheme --region us-east-1 --domain-name
       movies --analysis-scheme file://myscheme.txt

```
**Important**

To use an analysis scheme, you must apply it to one or more text or text-array

fields and rebuild the index. You can configure a field's analysis scheme with the aws
```
   cloudsearch define-index-field command. To rebuild the index, call aws
   cloudsearch index-documents.

```

#### Configuring Analysis Schemes Using the AWS SDKs

The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including DefineAnalysisScheme. For
[more information about installing and using the AWS SDKs, see AWS Software Development Kits.](http://aws.amazon.com/code)

**Important**

To use an analysis scheme, you must apply it to one or more text or text-array fields
and rebuild the index. You can configure a field's analysis scheme with the define index
field method. To rebuild your index, you use the index documents method.

#### Indexing Bigrams for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in Amazon CloudSearch

Chinese, Japanese, and Korean do not have explicit word boundaries. Simply indexing
individual characters (unigrams) can result in matches that aren't very relevant to a search
query. One solution is to index bigrams. A bigram is every sequence of two adjacent
characters in a string. For example, the following example shows bigrams for the string

:

While indexing bigrams can improve search result quality, keep in mind that it can significantly
increase the size of your index.

**To index bigrams for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean**

1. Create a text analysis scheme and set the language to multiple languages (mul).

2. Configure the index field that contains the CJK data to use your multi-language analysis
scheme.

When you assign an analysis scheme that sets a field's language to mul, Amazon CloudSearch
automatically generates bigrams for all Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text within the field.

If you are indexing Japanese content, you might also be interested in using a custom tokenization
dictionary with the standard Japanese language processor. For more information, see Customizing
Japanese Tokenization.

#### Customizing Japanese Tokenization in Amazon CloudSearch

If you need more control over how Amazon CloudSearch tokenizes Japanese, you can add a custom
Japanese tokenization dictionary to your analysis scheme. Configuring a custom tokenization
dictionary enables you to override how specific entries are tokenized by the standard Japanese
language processor. This can improve search result accuracy in some cases, particularly when you
need to index and retrieve domain-specific phrases.

A tokenization dictionary is a collection of entries where each entry specifies a set of characters,
how the characters should be tokenized, how each token should be pronounced (readings), and a
part-of-speech tag. You specify the dictionary as an array, and each dictionary entry is an array of
strings. The entries are of the following form:
```
 ["<text>","<token 1> ... <token n>","<reading 1> ... <reading n>","<part-of-speech
 tag>"]

```
You must specify a reading for each token and the part-of-speech tag for the entry. See Japanese
Part-of-Speech Tags for the part of speech tags that are treated as stopwords.

You use the JapaneseTokenizationDictionary key to define a custom tokenization dictionary
in an analysis scheme. Because you pass the tokenization dictionary to Amazon CloudSearch as
a string, you must escape all double quotes within the string. For example, the dictionary in the
following analysis scheme specifies segmentation overrides for Kanji and Katakana compounds,
and a custom reading for a proper name:

-----

When configuring an analysis scheme with the AWS CLI, you can store the analysis scheme in a text

file and specify that file as the --analysis-scheme value. This enables you to format the scheme

so that it's easier to read. For example, if you store the jascheme analysis scheme in a file called
```
jascheme.txt, you can pass that file in when you call aws cloudsearch define-analysisscheme:
 aws cloudsearch define-analysis-scheme --region us-east-1 --domain-name
 mydomain --analysis-scheme file://jascheme.txt

```
For more information about creating and using analysis schemes, see Configuring Analysis
Schemes.

##### Japanese Part-of-Speech Tags in Amazon CloudSearch

When you use a custom tokenization dictionary for Japanese, you specify a part-of-speech tag for
each entry. If the part-of-speech tag matches one of the tags configured as a stop tag, the entry is
treated as a stopword.

The following table shows the part of speech tags configured as stop tags in Amazon CloudSearch.

### Text Processing in Amazon CloudSearch

During indexing, Amazon CloudSearch processes text and text-array fields according to the
analysis scheme configured for the field to determine what terms to add to the index. Before the

analysis options are applied, the text is tokenized and normalized.

During tokenization, the stream of text in a field is split into separate tokens on detectable
boundaries using the word break rules defined in the Unicode Text Segmentation algorithm. For
[more information, see Unicode Text Segmentation.](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/)

According to the word break rules, strings separated by whitespace such as spaces and tabs are
treated as separate tokens. In many cases, punctuation is dropped and treated as whitespace.
For example, strings are split at hyphens (-) and the at symbol (@). However, periods that are not
followed by whitespace are considered part of the token.

Note that strings are not split on case boundariesâCamelCase strings are not tokenized.

During normalization, upper case characters are converted to lower case. Accents are typically
handled according to the stemming options configured in the field's analysis scheme. (The default
analysis scheme for English removes accents.)

Once tokenization and normalization are complete, the stemming options, stopwords, and
synonyms specified in the analysis scheme are applied.

When you submit a search request, the text you're searching for undergoes the same text
processing so that it can be matched against the terms that appear in the index. However, no
text analysis is performed on the search term when you perform a prefix search. This means that

a search for a prefix that ends in s typically won't match the singular version of the term when

stemming is enabled. This can happen for any term that ends in s, not just plurals. For example, if

you search the actor field in the sample movie data for Anders, there are three matching movies.

If you search for Ander*, you get those movies as well as several others. However, if you search for
```
Anders* there are no matches. This is because the term is stored in the index as ander, anders

```
does not appear in the index.

If stemming is preventing your wildcard searches from returning all of the relevant matches, you

can suppress stemming for the text field by setting the AlgorithmicStemming option to none, or

you can map the data to a literal field instead of a text field.

## Uploading and Indexing Data in Amazon CloudSearch

To make your data searchable, you need to format it in JSON or XML as described in Preparing
Your Data and upload it to your search domain for indexing. In most cases, Amazon CloudSearch
automatically indexes your data and the changes are visible in search results in just a few minutes.

However, certain changes to your domain configuration put the domain in the NEEDS INDEXING
state. For those changes to take effect, you must explicitly run indexing to rebuild your index.
Currently, you also need to periodically run indexing so your suggesters reflect the most recent
data in your index. The following sections describe how to upload data to your domain and run
indexing when it's needed.

**Important**

Rebuilding your index after data uploads is unnecessary and can cause your domain to
incur additional charges. You only need to rebuild your index after certain configuration
changes or after you have deleted documents and want them permanently removed from
the service.

### Uploading Data to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

**Important**

Before uploading data to an Amazon CloudSearch domain, follow these guidelines:

   - Group documents into batches before you upload them. Continuously uploading batches

that consist of only one document has a huge, negative impact on the speed at which
Amazon CloudSearch can process your updates. Instead, create batches that are as
close to the limit as possible and upload them less frequently. For more information on
maximum batch size and upload frequency, see Limits.

   - A domain's document and search endpoints remain the same for the life of the domain.

You should cache the endpoints rather than retrieving them before every upload or

search request. Querying the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service by calling aws
```
cloudsearch describe-domains or DescribeDomains before every request will

```
likely result in your requests being throttled.


You create document batches to describe the data that you want to upload to an Amazon
CloudSearch domain. A document batch is a collection of add and delete operations that represent

the documents you want to add, update, or delete from your domain. Batches can be described
in either JSON or XML. When you upload document batches to a domain, the data is indexed
automatically according to the domain's indexing options.

As your data changes, you upload batches to add, change, or delete documents from your index.
Amazon CloudSearch applies updates continuously. You only have to explicitly reindex your data

when you make configuration changes that put your domain in the NEEDS INDEXING state or

need to update suggesters.

**To upload data to your domain, it must be formatted as a valid JSON or XML batch. The fields**
specified in each document must correspond to index fields configured for the domain. However,
a document does not have to contain every configured index field. For information about creating
document batches, see Preparing Your Data. For information about configuring index fields for a
domain, see configure indexing options.

You are billed for the total number of document batches uploaded to your search domain,
including batches that contain delete operations. For more information about Amazon
[CloudSearch pricing, see aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/pricing/.](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/pricing/)

You can submit a document batch to a domain using the Amazon CloudSearch console, AWS CLI, or
by posting it directly to the domain's document service endpoint.

For more information about the document service API, see the Document Service API.

#### Submitting Document Upload Requests to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

**Important**

Before uploading data to an Amazon CloudSearch domain, follow these guidelines:

   - Group documents into batches before you upload them. Continuously uploading batches

that consist of only one document has a huge, negative impact on the speed at which
Amazon CloudSearch can process your updates. Instead, create batches that are as
close to the limit as possible and upload them less frequently. For more information on
maximum batch size and upload frequency, see Limits.

   - A domain's document and search endpoints remain the same for the life of the domain.

You should cache the endpoints rather than retrieving them before every upload or

search request. Querying the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service by calling aws
```
    cloudsearch describe-domains or DescribeDomains before every request will

```
likely result in your requests being throttled.

We recommend using one of the AWS SDKs or the AWS CLI to submit document upload requests.
The SDKs and AWS CLI handle request signing for you and provide an easy way to perform all
Amazon CloudSearch actions. You can also use the Amazon CloudSearch console to upload
individual batches and import data from DynamoDB or S3.

For example, the following request uploads a batch using the AWS CLI.
```
 aws cloudsearchdomain --endpoint-url http://doc-movies-y6gelr4lv3jeu4rvoelunxsl2e.us east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com upload-documents --content-type
 application/json --documents movie-data-2013.json

```
For development and testing purposes, you can allow anonymous access to your domain's
document service and submit unsigned HTTP POST requests directly to your domain's document
service. In a production environment, restrict access to your domain to specific IAM roles, groups,
or users and submit signed requests. For information about controlling access for Amazon
CloudSearch, see configure access policies. For more information about request signing, see
[Signing AWS API Requests.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html)

Submitting Document Upload Requests API Version 2013-01-01 125


-----

For example, the following POST request uploads a batch of documents formatted in JSON to the
domain endpoint doc-movies-123456789012.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com.
```
 curl -X POST --upload-file data1.json doc-movies-123456789012.us east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/documents/batch --header "Content-Type:
 application/json"

#### Bulk Uploads in Amazon CloudSearch

```
Document batches are limited to one batch every 10 seconds and 5 MB per batch. To learn more,
see Limits. However, you can upload batches in parallel to reduce the amount of time it takes to
upload all of your data.

To perform a bulk upload:

- Set your desired instance type to a larger instance type than the default search.small. The

number of upload threads you can use depends on the type of search instance your domain is
using and the nature of your data and indexing options. Larger instance types have a higher

upload capacity. Attempting to upload batches in parallel to a search.small instance usually
results in a high rate of 504 or 507 errors. For more information about setting the desired
instance type, see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

- Start uploading data once your configuration changes are active. If you encounter a high rate

of 5xx errors, you either need to reduce your upload rate or switch to a larger instance type. If
you are already using the largest instance type, you can increase the desired partition count to
further increase upload capacity.

**Important**

If you submit a large volume of updates while your domain is in the PROCESSING state,
it can increase the amount of time it takes for the updates to be applied to your search
index. To avoid this update lag, wait until your domain is in the ACTIVE state before
starting your bulk upload.

- When you are finished with your bulk upload, you can change the desired instance type back

to a smaller instance type. If your index fits on a smaller type, Amazon CloudSearch will
automatically scale your domain back down. Amazon CloudSearch will not scale to an instance
type that's smaller than the desired instance type configured for your domain.

Bulk Uploads API Version 2013-01-01 126


-----

For datasets of less than 1 GB of data or fewer than one million 1 KB documents, a small search
instance should be sufficient. To upload data sets between 1 GB and 8 GB, we recommend setting

the desired instance type to search.large before you begin uploading. For datasets between 8

GB and 16 GB, start with a search.xlarge. For datasets between 16 GB and 32 GB, start with a
```
search.2xlarge. If you have more than 32 GB to upload, select the search.2xlarge instance

```
type and increase the desired partition count to accommodate your data set. Each partition can
[contain up to 32 GB of data. Submit a Service Increase Limit Request if you need more upload](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudsearch-partitions-and-instances)
capacity or have more than 500 GB to index.

#### Uploading Data Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

In the Amazon CloudSearch console, you can upload data from your local file system or Amazon S3
to your domain from the domain dashboard. The console can automatically convert the following
types of files to document batches during the upload process:

- Document batches formatted in JSON or XML (.json, .xml)

- Comma Separated Value (.csv)

- Text Documents (.txt)

You can also convert and upload items from an DynamoDB table. For more information, see
Uploading DynamoDB Data.

**Note**

To upload data from Amazon S3 or DynamoDB, you must have permission to access both
[the service and the resources you want to upload. For more information, see Using Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingIAMPolicies.html)

[Policies and User Policies and Using IAM to Control Access to DynamoDB Resources.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingIAMPolicies.html)

CSV files are parsed row-by-row and a separate document is generated for each row. All other
types of files are treated as a single document. For more information about automatically
generating document batches, see Preparing Your Data.

**To send data to a domain for indexing**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In the left navigation pane, choose Domains.

Uploading Data Using the Console API Version 2013-01-01 127


-----

3. Choose the name of your domain to open the domain configuration.

4. Choose Actions, Upload documents.

5. Select the location of the data you want to upload to your domain:

  - Local machine

  - Amazon S3

  - Amazon DynamoDB

  - Sample data

If you upload data that isn't formatted as document batches, it will automatically be converted
during the upload process.

**Note**

If a batch is invalid, Amazon CloudSearch converts the content to a valid batch that
contains a single content field and generic metadata fields. Since these are not
normally the fields configured for the domain, you will get errors stating that the fields
don't exist.

6. Upload your data.

a. If you are uploading local files, select Choose file to locate the file(s) to upload.

b. If you are uploading objects from Amazon S3, provide the URI of the bucket to upload
from.

c. If you are uploading items from DynamoDB, select the table to upload from. To limit
the read capacity units that can be consumed while reading from the table, enter the
maximum percentage of read capacity units. To start reading from a particular item,
specify a start hash key.

d. If you're uploading predefined sample data, choose the data set to use.

7. Choose Continue.

8. Review the documents to be uploaded and choose Upload documents.

9. In the Upload Summary, if a document batch has been automatically generated from your
data, you can choose Download the generated document batch to get it. Choose Close to
return to the domain dashboard.

Uploading Data Using the Console API Version 2013-01-01 128


-----

#### Uploading Data Using the AWS CLI

You use the aws cloudsearch upload-documents command to send document batches to
[your search domain. For information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)
[Command Line Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

**To send document batches to a domain for indexing**

- Run the aws cloudsearchdomain upload-documents command to upload your batches
to your domain:
```
   aws cloudsearchdomain upload-documents --endpoint-url http://doc-movies   y6gelr4lv3jeu4rvoelunxsl2e.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com --content-type
    application/json --documents document-batch.json
   {
     "status": "success", 
     "adds": 5000, 
     "deletes": 0
   }

#### Posting Documents to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain's Document Service Endpoint via HTTP

```
You use the documents/batch resource to post document batches to your domain to add,
update, or remove documents. For example:
```
 curl -X POST --upload-file movie-data-2013.json doc-movies-123456789012.us east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/documents/batch --header "Content Type:application/json"

### Indexing Document Data with Amazon CloudSearch

```
When you send document updates to your domain, Amazon CloudSearch automatically updates
the domain's search index with the new data. You don't have to do anything for the updates to be
indexed. However, if you change the configuration of your domain's index fields or text options,
you must explicitly rebuild your search index for those changes to be visible in search results.
Because rebuilding the index can take a significant amount of time if you have a lot of data, you
should finish making all of your configuration changes before re-indexing your documents.

Uploading Data Using the AWS CLI API Version 2013-01-01 129


-----

**Important**

If you change the type of a field and have documents in your index that contain data
that is incompatible with the new field type, all fields being processed are put in the
```
FailedToValidate state when you run indexing and the indexing operation fails. Rolling

```
back the incompatible configuration change will enable you to successfully rebuild your
index. If the change is necessary, you must update or remove the incompatible documents
from your index to use the new configuration.


When you make changes that require re-indexing, the domain status changes to Needs
```
Indexing. While the index is being rebuilt, the domain's status is Processing. You can continue

```
to submit search requests while indexing is in process, but the configuration changes won't be

visible in search results until indexing completes and the domain's status changes to Active. You
can also continue to upload document batches to your domain. However, if you submit a large

volume of updates while your domain is in the Processing state, it can increase the amount of
time it takes for the updates to be applied to your search index. If this becomes an issue, slow your

update rate until the domain returns to the Active state.

**Note**

Depending on the volume of data, building a full index can take a considerable amount
of compute power. Amazon CloudSearch automatically manages the resources needed to
build the index in a timely fashion. Most data updates and simple domain configuration
changes are built and deployed in minutes. Indexing large volumes of data and applying
configuration changes that require rebuilding the full index will take longer to complete.

You can initiate indexing from the Amazon CloudSearch console, using the aws cloudsearch
```
index-documents command, or through the AWS SDKs.

Indexing Document Data API Version 2013-01-01 130


-----

#### Indexing Documents Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

When you make changes that require your domain's index to be rebuilt, the status shown on the
domain dashboard changes to NEEDS INDEXING. The console also displays a message at the top of
the configuration pages prompting you to run indexing when you are done making changes.

**To run indexing**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. From the left navigation pane, choose Domains.

3. Choose the name of the domain that needs indexing.

4. On the domain dashboard, choose Actions, Run indexing.

#### Indexing Documents Using the Amazon CloudSearch AWS CLI

You use the aws cloudsearch index-documents command to rebuild your domain's search
[index. For information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the AWS Command Line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)
[Interface User Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)

**To explicitly index your domain**

- Run the aws cloudsearch index-documents command. The following example rebuilds
the index for a domain called movies.

**Example**
```
   aws cloudsearch index-documents --domain-name movies

#### Indexing Documents with the AWS SDK

```
The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including IndexDocuments. For more

## Searching Your Data with Amazon CloudSearch

You specify the terms or values you want to search for with the q parameter. How you specify the

search criteria depends on which query parser you use. Amazon CloudSearch supports four query

parsers:

- simpleâsearch all text and text-array fields for the specified string. The simple query

parser enables you to search for phrases, individual terms, and prefixes. You can designate terms
as required or optional, or exclude matches that contain particular terms. To search particular

fields, you can specify the fields you want to search with the q.options parameter. The simple

query parser is used by default if the q.parser parameter is not specified.

- structuredâsearch specific fields, construct compound queries using Boolean operators, and

use advanced features such as term boosting and proximity searching.

- luceneâspecify search criteria using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax. If you currently

use the Lucene syntax, using the lucene query parser enables you to migrate your search
services to an Amazon CloudSearch domain without having to completely rewrite your search
queries in the Amazon CloudSearch structured search syntax.

- dismaxâspecify search criteria using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene query parser

syntax defined by the DisMax query parser. If you are currently using the DisMax syntax, using

the dismax query parser enables you to migrate your search services to an Amazon CloudSearch
domain without having to completely rewrite your search queries in the Amazon CloudSearch
structured search syntax.

You can use additional search parameters to control how search results are returned and include
additional information such as facets, highlights, and suggestions with your search results.

For information about all of the Amazon CloudSearch search parameters, see the Search API.

### Submitting Search Requests to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

We recommend using one of the AWS SDKs or the AWS CLI to submit search requests. The SDKs
and AWS CLI handle request signing for you and provide an easy way to perform all Amazon
CloudSearch actions. You can also use the Search Tester in the Amazon CloudSearch console to
search your data, browse the results, and view the generated request URLs and JSON and XML
responses. For more information, see Searching with the Search Tester.

**Important**

   - Search endpoints don't change: A domain's document and search endpoints remain

the same for the life of the domain. You should cache the endpoints rather than
retrieving them before every upload or search request. Querying the Amazon

CloudSearch configuration service by calling aws cloudsearch describe-domains

or DescribeDomains before every request is likely to result in your requests being
throttled.

   - IP addresses do change: Your domain's IP address can change over time, so it's important

to cache the endpoint as shown in the console and returned by the aws cloudsearch
```
    describe-domains command rather than the IP address. You should also re-resolve

```
[the endpoint DNS to an IP address regularly. For more information, see Setting the JVM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/java-dg-jvm-ttl.html)
[TTL for DNS Name Lookups.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/java-dg-jvm-ttl.html)

For example, the following request submits a simple text search for wolverine using the AWS CLI
and returns just the IDs of the matching documents.
```
 aws cloudsearchdomain --endpoint-url http://search-movies y6gelr4lv3jeu4rvoelunxsl2e.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com search --search-query
 wolverine --return _no_fields

By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns the response in JSON. You can get the results formatted

in XML by specifying the format parameter. Setting the response format only affects responses
to successful requests. The format of an error response depends on the origin of the error. Errors
returned by the search service are always returned in JSON. 5xx errors due to server timeouts and
other request routing problems are returned in XML.

**Note**

The AWS SDKs return fields as arrays. Single-value fields are returned as arrays with one
element, such as:
```
    "fields": {
     "plot": ["Katniss Everdeen reluctantly becomes the symbol of a mass rebellion
    against the autocratic Capitol."]
    }

```
For development and testing purposes, you can allow anonymous access to your domain's
search service and submit unsigned HTTP GET or POST requests directly to your domain's search

endpoint. In a production environment, restrict access to your domain to specific IAM roles, groups,
or users and submit signed requests using the AWS SDKs or AWS CLI. For information about
controlling access for Amazon CloudSearch, see configure access policies. For more information
[about request signing, see Signing AWS API Requests.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html)

You can use any method you want to send HTTP requests directly to your domain's search endpoint
âyou can enter the request URL directly in a Web browser, use cURL to submit the request, or
generate an HTTP call using your favorite HTTP library. To specify your search criteria, you specify
a query string that specifies the constraints for your search and what you want to get back in
the response. The query string must be URL-encoded. The maximum size of a search request
submitted via GET is 8190 bytes, including the HTTP method, URI, and protocol version. You can
submit larger requests using HTTP POST; however, keep in mind that large, complex requests take
longer to process and are more likely to time out. For more information, see Tuning Search Request
Performance in Amazon CloudSearch.

For example, the following request submits a structured query to the search-movies```
rr2f34ofg56xneuemujamut52i.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com domain and

```
gets the contents of the title field.
```
 http://search-movies-rr2f34ofg56xneuemujamut52i.us-east-1.cloudsearch.
 amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/search?q=(and+(term+field%3Dtitle+'star')
 (term+field%3Dyear+1977))&q.parser=structured&return=title

```
**Important**

Special characters in the query string must be URL-encoded. For example, you must encode

the = operator in a structured query as %3D: (term+field%3Dtitle+'star'). If you
don't encode the special characters when you submit the search request, you'll get an
```
   InvalidQueryString error.

#### Searching with the Search Tester

```
The search tester in the Amazon CloudSearch console enables you to submit sample search
requests using any of the supported query parsers: simple, structured, lucene, or dismax. By
default, requests are processed with the simple query parser. You can specify options for the
selected parser, filter and sort the results, and browse the configured facets. The search hits
are automatically highlighted in the search results. For information about how this is done,

Searching with the Search Tester API Version 2013-01-01 135


-----

see Highlighting Search Hits in Amazon CloudSearch. You can also select a suggester to get
suggestions as you enter terms in the Search field. (You must configure a suggester before you
can get suggestions. For more information see Getting Autocomplete Suggestions in Amazon
CloudSearch.)

By default, results are sorted according to an automatically-generated relevance score, _score. For
information about customizing how results are ranked, see Sorting Results in Amazon CloudSearch.

**To search your domain**

1. [Go to the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In the left navigation panel, choose the name of your domain to open its configuration.

3. Choose Run a test search.

4. To perform a simple text search, enter a search query and choose Run. By default, all text and
```
  text-array fields are searched.

```
To search particular fields, expand Options and enter a comma-separated list of the fields you
want to search in the Search fields field. You can append a weight to each field with a caret (^)
to control the relative importance of each field in the search results. For example, specifying
```
title^5, description weights hits in the title field five times more than hits in the
description field when calculating relevance scores for each matching document.

```
To use the structured query syntax, select Structured from the Query parser menu. Once you've
selected the structured query parser, enter your structured query in the Search field and choose
**Run. For example, to find all of the movies with star in the title that were released in the year 2000**

or earlier, you could enter: (and title:'star' year:{,2000]). For more information, see
Constructing Compound Queries. To submit Lucene or DisMax queries, select the appropriate query
parser.

You can specify additional options for the selected query parser to configure the default operator
and control which operators can be used in a query. For more information, see Search Request
Parameters.

You can copy and paste the request URL to submit the request and view the response from a Web
browser. Requests can be sent via HTTP or HTTPS.

### Constructing Compound Queries in Amazon CloudSearch

You can use the structured query parser to combine match expressions using Boolean and, or, and
```
not operators. To select the structured query parser, you include q.parser=structured in your

```
query. The structured query operators are specified as prefix operators. The syntax is:

- (and boost=N EXPRESSION1 EXPRESSION2 ... EXPRESSIONn)

- (or boost=N EXPRESSION1 EXPRESSION2 ... EXPRESSIONn)

- (not boost=N EXPRESSION)

For example, the following query matches all movies in the sample data set that contain star in the

title, and either Harrison Ford or William Shatner appear in the actors field, but Zachary Quinto
does not.
```
 (and title:'star' (or actors:'Harrison Ford' actors:'William Shatner')(not
 actors:'Zachary Quinto'))

```
When using the structured query operators, you specify the name of the operator, options

for the operator, and then the match expression being operated on, (OPERATOR OPTIONS
```
EXPRESSION). The match expression can be a simple text string, or a subclause of your compound

```
query. Any options must be specified before the terms. For example, (and (not field=genres
```
'Sci-Fi')(or (term field=title boost=2 'star')(term field=plot 'star'))).

```
Parentheses control the order of evaluation of the expressions. When an expression is enclosed
in parentheses, that expression is evaluated first, and then the resulting value is used in the
evaluation of the remainder of the compound query.

**Important**

You must URL-encode special characters in the query string. For example, you must encode

the = operator in a structured query as %3D: (term+field%3Dtitle+'star'). Amazon

CloudSearch returns an InvalidQueryString error if special characters are not URL[encoded. For a complete reference of URL-encodings, see the W3C HTML URL Encoding](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)
[Reference.](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)

Constructing Compound Queries API Version 2013-01-01 137


-----

For example, the following query searches the title field for the phrase star wars and excludes

matches that have a value less than 2000 in the year field.
```
 (and (phrase field='title' 'star wars') (not (range field=year {,2000})))

```
To submit this search request, you need to encode the query string and specify the structured

query parser with the q.parser parameter.
```
 http://search-movies-rr2f34ofg56xneuemujamut52i.us-east-1.cloudsearch.
 amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/search?q=(and+(phrase+field='title'+'star wars')+(not+(range
 +field%3Dyear+{,2000})))&q.parser=structured

```
The structured query syntax enables you to combine searches against multiple fields. If you don't

specify a field to search, all text and text-array fields are searched. For example, the following

query searches all text and text-array fields for the term star, and excludes documents that

contain Zachary Quinto in the actors field.
```
 (and 'star' (not actors:'Zachary Quinto'))

```
You can specify a boost value to increase the importance of one expression in a compound query
in relation to the others. The boost value increases the scores of the matching documents. For

example, the following query boosts matches for the term star if they occur in the title field

rather than the description field.
```
 (and (range field=year [2013,}) (or (term field=title boost=2 'star') (term field=plot
 'star'))

```
Boost values must be greater than zero.

In addition to and, or, and not, the Amazon CloudSearch structured search syntax supports
several specialized operators:

- matchallâMatches every document in the domain. Syntax: matchall.

- nearâSupports sloppy phrase queries. The distance value specifies the maximum number

of words that can separate the words in the phrase; for example, (near field='plot'
```
 distance=4 'naval mutiny demonstration'). Use the near operator to enable matching

```
when the specified terms are in close proximity, but not adjacent. For more information about

Constructing Compound Queries API Version 2013-01-01 138


-----

sloppy phrase searches, see Searching for Phrases. Syntax: (near field=FIELD distance=N
```
 boost=N 'STRING').

```
- phraseâSearches for a phrase in text or text-array fields; for example, (phrase
```
 field="title" 'teenage mutant ninja'). Supports boosting documents that match

```
the expression. For more information about phrase searches, see Searching for Phrases. Syntax:
```
 (phrase field=FIELD boost=N 'STRING').

```
- prefixâSearches a text, text-array, literal, or literal-array field for the specified prefix followed

by zero or more characters; for example, (prefix field='title' 'wait'). Supports
boosting documents that match the expression. For more information about prefix searches, see

Searching for Prefixes.Syntax: (prefix field=FIELD boost=N 'STRING').

- rangeâSearches for a range of values in a numeric field; for example: (range field=year
```
 [2000,2013]). For more information about range searches, see Searching for a Range of

```
Values. Syntax: (range field=FIELD boost=N RANGE).

- termâSearches for an individual term or value in any field; for example: (and (term
```
 field=title 'star')(term field=year 1977)). Syntax: (term field=FIELD
 boost=N 'STRING'|VALUE).

```
For more information about searching particular types of data, see the following sections. For more
information about the structured search syntax, see Structured Search Syntax.

### Searching for Text in Amazon CloudSearch

You can search both text and literal fields for a text string:

- Text and text-array fields are always searchable. You can search for individual terms as well

as phrases. Searches within text and text-array fields are not case-sensitive.

- Literal and literal-array fields can only be searched if they are search enabled in the

domain's indexing options. You can search for an exact match of your search string. Searches in
literal fields are case-sensitive.

If you use the simple query parser or do not specify a field when searching with the structured

query parser, by default all text and text-array fields are searched. Literal fields are not

searched by default. You can specify which fields you want to search with the q.options
parameter.

Searching for Text in Amazon CloudSearch API Version 2013-01-01 139


-----

You can search the unique document ID field like any text field. To reference the document ID field

in a search request, you use the field name _id. Document IDs are always returned in the search
results.

#### Searching for Individual Terms in Amazon CloudSearch

When you search text and text-array fields for individual terms, Amazon CloudSearch finds
all documents that contain the search terms anywhere within the specified field, in any order. For

example, in the sample movie data, the title field is configured as a text field. If you search the
```
title field for star, you will find all of the movies that contain star anywhere in the title field,

```
such as star, star wars, and a star is born. This differs from searching literal fields, where the
field value must be identical to the search string to be considered a match.

The simple query parser provides an easy way to search text and text-array fields for one or

more terms. The simple query parser is used by default unless you use the q.parser parameter
to specify a different query parser.

For example, to search for katniss, specify katniss in the query string. By default, Amazon

CloudSearch includes all return enabled fields in the search results. You can specify the return
parameter to specify which fields you want to return.
```
 https://search-domainname-domainid.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/
 2013-01-01/search?q=katniss&return=title

```
By default, the response is returned in JSON:
```
 {
   "status": {
     "rid": "rd+5+r0oMAo6swY=",
     "time-ms": 9
   },

```
Searching for Individual Terms API Version 2013-01-01 140


-----

```
  "hits": {
    "found": 3,
    "start": 0,
    "hit": [
      {
        "id": "tt1951265",
        "fields": {
          "title": "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "tt1951264",
        "fields": {
          "title": "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "tt1392170",
        "fields": {
          "title": "The Hunger Games"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

To specify multiple terms, separate the terms with a space. For example: star wars. When you
specify multiple search terms, by default documents must contain all of the terms to be considered
a match. The terms can occur anywhere within the text field, in any order.

By default, all text and text-array fields are searched when you use the simple query parser.

You can specify which fields you want to search by specifying the q.options parameter. For

example, this query constrains the search to the title and description fields and boosts the

importance of matches in the title field over matches in the description field.
```
 q=star wars&q.options={fields: ['title^5','description']}

```
When you use the simple query parser, you can use the following prefixes to designate individual
terms as required, optional, or to be excluded from the search results:

- +âmatching documents must contain the term. This is the defaultâseparating terms with a

space is equivalent to preceding them with the + prefix.

Searching for Individual Terms API Version 2013-01-01 141


-----

- -âexclude documents that contain the term from the search results. The - operator only applies

to individual terms. For example, to exclude documents that contain the term star in the default

search field, specify: -star. Searching for search?q=-star wars retrieves all documents that
do not contain the term star, but do contain the term wars.

- |âinclude documents that contain the term in the search results, even if they don't contain the

other terms. The | operator only applies to individual terms. For example, to include documents

that contain either of two terms, specify: term1 |term2. Searching for search?q=star wars
```
 |trek includes documents that contain both star and wars, or the term trek.

```
These prefixes only apply to individual terms in a simple query. To construct compound queries,
you need to use the structured query parser, rather than the simple query parser. For example, to
search for the terms star and wars using the structured query parser you would specify:
```
 (and 'star' 'wars')

```
Note that this query matches documents that contain each of the terms in any of the fields being
searched. The terms do not have to be in the same field to be considered a match. If, however, you

specify (and 'star wars' 'luke'), star and wars must occur within the same field, and luke
can occur in any of the fields.

If you don't specify any fields when you use the structured query parser, all text and text```
array fields are searched by default, just like with the simple parser. Similarly, you can use

```
the q.options parameter to control which fields are searched and to boost the importance of
selected fields. For more information, see Constructing Compound Queries.

You can also perform fuzzy searches with the simple query parser. To perform a fuzzy search,

append the ~ operator and a value that indicates how much terms can differ from the user query

string and still be considered a match. For example, the specifying planit~1 searches for the term
_planit and allows matches to differ by up to one character, which means the results will include hits_
for planet.

#### Searching for Phrases in Amazon CloudSearch

When you search for a phrase, Amazon CloudSearch finds all documents that contain the complete
phrase in the order specified. You can also perform sloppy phrase searches where the terms appear
within the specified distance of one another.

Searching for Phrases API Version 2013-01-01 142


-----

To match a complete phrase rather than the individual terms in the phrase when you search with
the simple query parser, enclose the phrase in double quotes. For example, the following query
searches for the phrase with love.
```
 q="with love"

```
To perform a sloppy phrase search with the simple query parser, append the ~ operator and a
distance value. The distance value specifies the maximum number of words that can separate the
words in the phrase. For example, the following query searches for the terms with love within three
words of one another.
```
 q="with love"~3

```
In a compound query, you use the phrase operator to specify the phrase you want to match; for
example:
```
 (phrase field=title 'star wars')

```
To perform a sloppy phrase search in a compound query, you use the near operator. The near
operator enables you to specify the phrase you are looking for and how far apart the terms can
be within a field and still be considered a match. For example, the following query matches

documents that have the terms star and wars no more than three words apart in the title field.
```
 (near field=title distance=3 'star wars')

```
For more information, see Constructing Compound Queries.

#### Searching for Literal Strings in Amazon CloudSearch

When you search a literal field for a string, Amazon CloudSearch returns only those documents
that contain an exact match for the complete search string in the specified field, including case. For

example, if the title field is configured as a literal field and you search for Star, the value of the
```
title field must be Star to be considered a matchâstar, star wars and a star is born will not be

```
included in the search results. This differs from text fields, where searches are not case-sensitive
and the specified search terms can appear anywhere within the field in any order.

To search a literal field, prefix the search string with the name of the literal field you want to
search, followed by a colon. The search string must be enclosed in single quotes. For example, the
following query searches for the literal string Sci-Fi.

Searching for Literal Strings API Version 2013-01-01 143


-----

```
genres:'Sci-Fi'

```

This example searches the genre field of each document and matches all documents whose genre

field contains the value Sci-Fi. To be a match, the field value must be an exact match for the search

string, including case. For example, documents that contain the value Sci-Fi in the genre field will
not be included in the search results if you search for sci-fi or young adult sci-fi.

In a compound query, you use the term operator syntax to search literal fields. For example, (term
```
field=genres 'Sci-Fi'). For more information, see Constructing Compound Queries.

```
You can use literal fields in conjunction with faceting to enable users to drill down into the results
according to the faceted attributes. For more information about faceting, see Getting and Using
Facet Information in Amazon CloudSearch.

#### Searching for Prefixes in Amazon CloudSearch

You can search text, text-array, literal, and literal-array fields for a prefix rather
than for a complete term. This matches results that contain the prefix followed by zero or more
characters. You must specify at least one character as the prefix. (To match all documents, use the
```
matchall operator in a structured query.) In general, you should use a prefix that contains at least

```
two characters to avoid matching an excessive number of documents.

When you search a text or text-array field, terms that match the prefix can occur anywhere
within the contents of the field. When you search literal fields, the entire search string, up to and
including the prefix characters, must match exactly.

- Simple query parserâuse the * (asterisk) wildcard operator to search for a prefix, for example
```
 pre*.

```
- Structured query parserâuse the prefix operator to search for a prefix, for example prefix
```
 'pre'

```
For example, the following query searches for the prefix oce in the title field and returns the title of
each hit:
```
 q=oce*&q.options={fields:['title']}&return=title

```
If you perform this search against the sample movie data, it returns as Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's
_Twelve:_

```
{
  "status": {
    "rid": "hIbIxb8oRAo6swY=",
    "time-ms": 2
  },
  "hits": {
    "found": 2,
    "start": 0,
    "hit": [
      {
        "id": "tt0240772",
        "fields": {
          "title": "Ocean's Eleven"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "tt0349903",
        "fields": {
          "title": "Ocean's Twelve"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

In a compound query, you use the prefix operator to search for prefixes. For example, to search

the title field for the prefix oce, you specify:
```
 q.parser=structured&q=(prefix field%3Dtitle 'oce')

```
Note the URL encoding. For more information, see Constructing Compound Queries.

**Note**

When performing wildcard searches on text fields, keep in mind that Amazon CloudSearch
tokenizes the text fields during indexing and performs stemming according to the analysis
scheme configured for the field. Normally, Amazon CloudSearch performs the same text
processing on the search query. However, when you search for a prefix with the wildcard

operator (*) or prefix operator, no stemming is performed on the prefix. This means

Searching for Prefixes API Version 2013-01-01 145


-----

that a search for a prefix that ends in s won't match the singular version of the term. This

can happen for any term that ends in s, not just plurals. For example, if you search the
```
actor field in the sample movie data for Anders, there are three matching movies. If

```
you search for Ander*, you get those movies as well as several others. However, if you

search for Anders* there are no matches. This is because the term is stored in the index

as ander, anders does not appear in the index. For more information about how Amazon
CloudSearch processes text and how it can affect searches, see Text Processing in Amazon
CloudSearch.


### Searching for Numbers in Amazon CloudSearch

You can use structured queries to search any search enabled numeric field for a particular value or

range of values. Amazon CloudSearch supports four numeric field types: double, double-array,
```
int, and int-array. For more information, see configure indexing options.

```
The basic syntax for searching a field for a single value is FIELD:VALUE. For example, year:2010
searches the sample movie data for movies released in 2010.

You must use the structured query parser to use the field syntax. Note that numeric values are not
enclosed in quotesâquotes designate a value as a string. To search for a range of values, use a
comma (,) to separate the upper and lower bounds, and enclose the range using brackets or braces.
For more information, see Searching for a Range of Values.

In a compound query, you use the term operator syntax to search for a single value: (term
```
field=year 2010).

### Searching for Dates and Times in Amazon CloudSearch

```
You can use structured queries to search any search enabled date field for a particular date and

time or a date-time range. Amazon CloudSearch supports two date field types, date and date```
array. For more information, see configure indexing options.

```
[Dates and times are specified in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) according to IETF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)

[RFC3339: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ. In UTC, for example, 5:00 PM August 23, 1970 is:](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
```
1970-08-23T17:00:00Z. Note that you can also specify fractional seconds when specifying times

```
in UTC. For example, 1967-01-31T23:20:50.650Z.

Searching for Numbers API Version 2013-01-01 146


-----

To search for a date (or time) in a date field, you must enclose the date string in single quotes. For
example, both of the following queries search the movie data for all movies released at midnight
on December 25, 2001:
```
 q.parser=structured&q=release_date:'2001-12-25T00:00:00Z'
 q.parser=structured&q=(term field%3Drelease_date '2001-12-25T00:00:00Z')

```
To search an entire day, see the section called âSearching for a Date Rangeâ.

### Searching for a Range of Values in Amazon CloudSearch

You can use structured queries to search a field for a range of values. To specify a range of values,
use a comma (,) to separate the upper and lower bounds and enclose the range using brackets or
braces. A square brace, [ or ], indicates that the bound is included in the range, a curly brace, { or },
excludes the bound.

For example, to search the sample data set for movies released from 2008 to 2010 (inclusive),

specify the range as [2008,2010].

To specify an open-ended range, omit the bound. For example, year:[2002,} matches all movies

released from 2002 onward, and year:{,1970] matches all movies released through 1970. When
you omit a bound, you must use a curly brace.

In a compound query, you use the range operator syntax to search for a range of values; for

example: (range field=year [1967,}).

#### Searching for a Date Range

To search for a range of dates (or times) in a date field, you use the same bracketed range
syntax that you use for numeric values, but you must enclose the date string in single quotes.
For example, the following request searches the movie data for all movies with a release date of
January 1, 2013 or later:
```
 q.parser=structured&q=release_date:['2013-01-01T00:00:00Z',}

```
Use the following syntax to search for a fixed range:
```
 q.parser=structured&q=release_date:['2013-01-01T00:00:00Z','2013-01-02T23:59:59Z']

```
Searching for a Range of Values API Version 2013-01-01 147


-----

#### Searching for a Location Range

You can perform a bounding box search by searching for a range of locations. To search for a range

of locations in a latlon field, you use the same bracketed range syntax that you use for numeric
values, but you must enclose the latitude/longitude pair in single quotes.

For example, if you include a location field in each document, you could specify your bounding

box filter as location:['nn.n,nn.n','nn.n,nn.n']. In the following example, the matches
for restaurant are filtered so that only matches within the downtown area of Paso Robles, CA are
included in the results.
```
 q='restaurant'&fq=location:
 ['35.628611,-120.694152','35.621966,-120.686706']&q.parser=structured

```
For more information, see location-based searching and sorting.

#### Searching for a Text Range

You can also search a text or literal field for a range of values using the bracketed range syntax.
Like dates, the text strings must be enclosed in single quotes. For example, the following request
searches the movie data for a range of document IDs. To reference a document's ID, you use the

special field name _id.
```
 _id:['tt1000000','tt1005000']

### Searching and Ranking Results by Geographic Location in Amazon CloudSearch

```
If you store locations in your document data using a latlon field, you can use the haversin
function in an Amazon CloudSearch expression to compute the distance between two locations.
Storing locations with your document data also enables you to easily search within particular areas.

Searching for a Location Range API Version 2013-01-01 148


-----

#### Searching Within an Area in Amazon CloudSearch

To associate a location with a search document, you can store the location's latitude and longitude

in a latlon field using decimal degree notation. The values are specified as a comma-separated

list, lat,lonâfor example 35.628611,-120.694152. Associating a location with a document

enables you to easily constrain search hits to a particular area with the fq parameter.

**To use a bounding box to constrain results to a particular area**

1. Determine the latitude and longitude of the upper-left and lower-right corners of the area you
are interested in.

2. Use the fq parameter to filter the matching documents using those bounding box coordinates.

For example, if you include a location field in each document, you could specify your

bounding box filter as fq=location:['nn.n,nn.n','nn.n,nn.n'] . In the following
example, the matches for restaurant are filtered so that only matches within the downtown
area of Paso Robles, CA are included in the results.
```
   q='restaurant'&fq=location:
   ['35.628611,-120.694152','35.621966,-120.686706']&q.parser=structured

#### Sorting Results by Distance in Amazon CloudSearch

```
You can define an expression as part of your search request to sort results by distance. Amazon

CloudSearch expressions support the haversin function, which computes the great-circle
distance between two points on a sphere using the latitude and longitude of each point. (For more
[information, see Haversine formula.) The resulting distance is returned in kilometers.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

To calculate the distance between each matching document and the user, you pass the

user's location into the haversin function and reference the document locations stored

in a latlon field. You specify the user latitude and longitude in decimal degree notation

and access the latitude and longitude stored in a latlon as FIELD.latitude and
```
FIELD.longitude. For example, expr.distance=haversin(userlat,userlon,
location.latitude,location.longitude).

```
To use the expression to sort the search results, you specify the sort parameter.

For example, the following query searches for restaurants and sorts the results by distance from
the user.

Searching Within an Area API Version 2013-01-01 149


-----

```
 q=restaurant&expr.distance=haversin(35.621966,-120.686706,location.latitude,location.longitude)
 asc

```
Note that you must explicitly specify the sort direction, asc or desc.

You can include the distance calculated for each document in the search results by specifying the

name of the expression with the return parameter. For example, return=distance.

You can also use the distance value in more complex expressions to take other characteristics

into account, such as a document's relevance _score. In the following example, a second rank

expression uses both the document's calculated distance and its relevance _score.
```
 expr.distance=haversin(38.958687,-77.343149,latitude,longitude)&expr.myrank=_score/
 log10(distance)&sort=myrank+desc

```
**Tip**

For these sample queries to work, you must configure your index with a latlon field and

have location data in your documents:
```
    {
     "fields": {
      "location": "40.05830,-74.40570"
     }
    }

```
If the field doesn't exist, you might receive the following error message when performing a
search:
```
    Syntax error in query: field (location) does not exist.

```
For more information about using expressions to sort search results, see Controlling Search Results.

### Searching DynamoDB Data with Amazon CloudSearch

You can specify a DynamoDB table as a source when configuring indexing options or uploading
data to a search domain through the console. This enables you to quickly set up a search domain to
experiment with searching data stored in DynamoDB database tables.

To keep your search domain in sync with changes to the table, you can send updates to both your
table and your search domain, or you can periodically load the entire table into a new search
domain.

**Topics**

- Configuring an Amazon CloudSearch Domain to Search DynamoDB Data

- Uploading Data to Amazon CloudSearch from DynamoDB

- Synchronizing a Search Domain with a DynamoDB Table

#### Configuring an Amazon CloudSearch Domain to Search DynamoDB Data

The easiest way to configure a search domain to search DynamoDB data is to use the Amazon
CloudSearch console. The console's configuration wizard analyzes your table data and suggests
indexing options based on the attributes in the table. You can modify the suggested configuration
to control which table attributes are indexed.

**Note**

To upload data from DynamoDB, you must have permission to access both the service and
[the resources you want to upload. For more information, see Using IAM to Control Access to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/UsingIAMWithDDB.html)
[DynamoDB Resources.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/UsingIAMWithDDB.html)

When you automatically configure a search domain from a DynamoDB table, a maximum of 200
unique attributes can be mapped to index fields. (You cannot configure more than 200 fields for a
search domain, so you can only upload data from DynamoDB tables with 200 or fewer attributes.)
When Amazon CloudSearch detects an attribute that has a small number of distinct values, the
field is facet enabled in the suggested configuration.

Searching DynamoDB Data API Version 2013-01-01 151


-----

**Important**

When you use a DynamoDB table to configure a domain, the data is not automatically
uploaded to the domain for indexing. You must upload the data for indexing as a separate
step after you configure the domain.


##### Configuring a Domain to Search DynamoDB using the Amazon CloudSearch Console

You can use the Amazon CloudSearch console to analyze data from a DynamoDB table to configure
a search domain. A maximum of 5 MB is read from the table regardless of the table size. By default,
Amazon CloudSearch reads from the beginning of the table. You can specify a start key to begin
reading from a particular item.

**To configure a search domain using a DynamoDB table**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. From the left navigation pane, choose Domains.

3. Choose the name of the domain to open its details panel.

4. Go to the Indexing options tab and choose Configuration wizard.

5. Select Amazon DynamoDB.

6. Select the DynamoDB table that you want to analyze.

  - To limit the read capacity units that can be consumed while reading from the table, enter

the maximum percentage of read capacity units you want to use.

   - To start reading from a particular item, specify a Start hash key. If the table uses a hash and

range type primary key, specify both the hash attribute and the range attribute for the item.

7. Choose Next.

8. Review the suggested configuration. You can edit these fields and add additional fields.

9. When you finish, choose Confirm.

10. If you haven't uploaded data to your domain yet, clear the Run indexing now checkbox to exit

without indexing. If you're done making configuration changes and are ready to index your
data with the new configuration, make sure Run indexing now is selected. When you're ready
to apply the changes, choose Finish.

#### Uploading Data to Amazon CloudSearch from DynamoDB

You can upload DynamoDB data to a search domain through the Amazon CloudSearch console
or with the Amazon CloudSearch command line tools. When you upload data from a DynamoDB
table, Amazon CloudSearch converts it to document batches so it can be indexed. You select define
index fields for each of the attributes in your domain configuration. For more information, see
Configuring an Amazon CloudSearch Domain to Search DynamoDB Data.

You can upload data from more than one DynamoDB table to the same Amazon CloudSearch
domain. However, keep in mind that you can upload a maximum of 200 attributes from all tables
combined. If an item with the same key appears in more than one uploaded table, the last-applied
item overwrites all previous versions.

When converting table data to document batches, Amazon CloudSearch generates a document
for each item it reads from the table, and represents each item attribute as a document field. The

unique ID for each document is either read from the docid item attribute (if it exists) or assigned
an alphanumeric value based on the primary key.

When Amazon CloudSearch generates documents for table items:

- Sets of strings and sets of numbers are represented as multi-value fields. If a DynamoDB set

contains more than 100 values, only the first 100 values are added to the multi-value field.

- DynamoDB binary attributes are ignored.

- Attribute names are modified to conform to the Amazon CloudSearch naming conventions for

field names:

 - All uppercase letters are converted to lowercase.

 - If the DynamoDB attribute name does not begin with a letter, the field name is prefixed with
```
  f_.

```
 - Any characters other than a-z, 0-9, and _ (underscore) are replaced by an underscore. If this

transformation results in a duplicate field name, a number is appended to make the field name

unique. For example, the attribute names hÃ¥t, h-t, hÃ¡t would be mapped to h_t, h_t1, and
```
  h_t2 respectively.

```
 - If the DynamoDB attribute name exceeds 64 characters, the first 56 characters of the attribute

name are concatenated with the 8-character MD5 hash of the full attribute name to form the
field name.

 - If the attribute name is body, it is mapped to the field name f_body.

 - If the attribute name is _score it is mapped to the field name f_ _score.

Uploading Data from DynamoDB API Version 2013-01-01 153


-----

- Number attributes are mapped to Amazon CloudSearch int fields and the values are transformed

to 32-bit unsigned integers:

 - If a number attribute contains a decimal value, only the integral part of the value is stored.

Everything to the right of the decimal point is dropped.

 - If the value is larger than can be stored as an unsigned integer, the value is truncated.

 - Negative integers are treated as unsigned positive integers.

##### Uploading DynamoDB Data to a Domain through the Amazon CloudSearch Console

You can use the Amazon CloudSearch console to upload up to 5 MB of data from a DynamoDB
table to a search domain.

**To upload DynamoDB data using the console**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. From the left navigation pane, choose Domains.

3. Choose the name of the domain to open its configuration.

4. Choose Actions, Upload documents.

5. Select Amazon DynamoDB.

6. From the dropdown, select the DynamoDB table that contains your data.

  - To limit the read capacity units that can be consumed while reading from the table, enter

the maximum percentage of read capacity units.

   - To start reading from a particular item, specify a Start hash key. If the table uses a hash and

range type primary key, specify both the hash attribute and the range attribute for the item.

7. When you finish specifying the table options, choose Next.

8. Review the items that will be uploaded. You can also save the generated document batch by
choosing Download the generated document batch. Then choose Upload documents.

#### Synchronizing a Search Domain with a DynamoDB Table

To keep your search domain in sync with updates to your DynamoDB table, you can either
programmatically track and apply updates to your domain, or periodically create a new domain

Synchronizing a Search Domain with a DynamoDB Table API Version 2013-01-01 154


-----

and upload the entire table again. If you have a large amount of data, it's best to track and apply
updates programmatically.

##### Programmatically Synchronizing Updates

To synchronize changes and additions to your DynamoDB table, you can create a separate update
table to track the changes to the table you are searching and periodically upload the contents of
the update table to the corresponding search domain.

To remove documents from the search domain, you must generate and upload document batches
that contain a delete operation for each deleted document. One option is to use a separate
DynamoDB table to track deleted items, periodically process the table to generate a batch of
delete operations, and upload the batch to your search domain.

To make sure that you don't lose any changes that are made during the initial data upload, you
must begin collecting tracking changes before the initial data upload. While you might update
some Amazon CloudSearch documents with identical data, you ensure that no changes are lost and
your search domain contains an up-to-date version of every document.

How often you synchronize updates depends on the volume of changes and your update latency
tolerance. One approach is to accumulate changes over a fixed time period and at the end of the
time period upload the changes and delete the period's tracking tables.

For example, to synchronize changes and additions once a day, at the beginning of each day you
could create a table called updates_YYYY_MM_DD to collect the daily updates. At the end of
the day, you upload the updates_YYYY_MM_DD table to your search domain. After the upload is
complete, you can delete the update table and create a new one for the next day.

##### Switching to a New Search Domain

If you don't want to track and apply individual updates to your table, you can periodically load the
entire table into a new search domain and then switch your query traffic over to the new domain.

**To switch to a new search domain**

1. Create a new search domain and copy the configuration from your existing domain.

2. Upload the entire DynamoDB table to the new domain. For more information, see Uploading
Data to Amazon CloudSearch from DynamoDB.

Synchronizing a Search Domain with a DynamoDB Table API Version 2013-01-01 155


-----

3. After the new domain is active, update the DNS entry that directs query traffic to the old
[search domain to point to the new domain. For example, if you use Amazon Route 53, you can](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
simply update the recordset with your new search service endpoint.

4. Delete the old domain.

### Filtering Matching Documents in Amazon CloudSearch

You use the fq parameter to filter the documents that match the search criteria specified with the
```
q parameter without affecting the relevance scores of the documents included in the search results.

```
Specifying a filter just controls which matching documents are included in the results, it has no
effect on how they are scored and sorted.

The fq parameter supports the structured query syntax described in Search API.

For example, you could add an available field to your documents to indicate whether or not an
item is in stock, and filter on that field to limit the results to in-stock items:
```
 search?q=star+wars&fq=available:'true'&return=title

### Tuning Search Request Performance in Amazon CloudSearch

```
Search requests can become very resource intensive to process, which can have an impact on the
performance and cost of running your search domain. In general, searches that return a large
volume of hits and complex structured queries are more resource intensive than simple text queries

that match a small percentage of the documents in your search domain.

If you experience slow response times, frequently encounter internal server errors (typically 507 or
509 errors), or see the number of instance hours your search domain consumes increase without a
substantial increase in the volume of data you're searching, you can fine-tune your search requests
to help reduce the processing overhead. This section reviews what to look for and steps you can
take to tune your search requests.

#### Analyzing Query Latency

Before you can tune your requests, you must analyze your current search performance. Log your
search requests and response times so that you can see which requests take the longest to process.

Filtering Matching Documents API Version 2013-01-01 156


-----

Slow searches can disproportionally affect overall performance by tying up your search domain's
resources. Optimizing the slowest search requests speeds up all of your searches.

**Topics**

- Reducing the Number of Hits

- Simplifying Structured Queries

##### Reducing the Number of Hits

Query latency is directly proportional to the number of matching documents. Searches that match
the most documents are generally the slowest.

Eliminating two types of searches that commonly result in a huge number of matching documents
can significantly improve overall performance:

- Queries that match every document in your corpus (matchall). While this can be a convenient

way to list all the documents in your domain, it's a resource intensive query. If you have a lot of
documents, not only can it cause other requests to time out, it's likely to time out itself.

- Prefix (wildcard) searches with only one or two characters specified. If you're using this type of

search to provide instant results as the user types, wait until the user has entered at least two
characters before you start submitting requests and displaying the possible matches.

To reduce the number of documents that match your requests, you can also do the following:

- Eliminate irrelevant words from your corpus so they aren't using for matching. The easiest way

to do this is to add them to the stopwords list dictionary for the analysis scheme(s) you're using.
Alternatively, you can preprocess your data to strip out irrelevant words. Eliminating irrelevant
words also has the benefit of reducing the size of your index, which can help reduce costs.

- Explicitly filter the results based on the value of a particular field using the fq parameter.

If you still have requests that match a lot of documents, you can reduce latency by minimizing the
amount of processing to be done on the result set:

- Minimize the facet information that you request. Generating the facet counts adds to the time it

takes to process the request and increases the likelihood that other requests will time out. If you
do request facet information, keep in mind that the more facets you specify, the longer it takes
to process the request.

Analyzing Query Latency API Version 2013-01-01 157


-----

- Avoid using your own expressions for sorting. The additional processing required to sort the

results increases the likelihood that requests will time out. If you must customize how the results
are sorted, it is generally faster to use a field than to use an expression.

Keep in mind that returning a large amount of data in the search results can increase the
transport time and affect query latency. Minimize the number of return fields you use to improve
performance and reduce the size of your index.

##### Simplifying Structured Queries

The more clauses there are in the query criteria, the longer it takes to process the query.

If you have complex structured queries that don't perform well, you need to find a way to reduce
the number of clauses. In some cases, you might simply be able to set a limit or reformulate the
query. In others, you might need to modify your domain configuration to accommodate simpler
queries.

## Querying Your Search Domain for More Information in Amazon CloudSearch

When you submit a search request, Amazon CloudSearch returns a collection of the documents
that match your search criteria. You can also retrieve:

- The contents of selected fields

- Facet information that enables you to categorize the results

- Statistics for the values contained in numeric fields

- Highlights that show the search hits in the field data

- Autocomplete suggestions

- Getting Statistics for Numeric Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

- Getting and Using Facet Information in Amazon CloudSearch

- Highlighting Search Hits in Amazon CloudSearch

- Getting Autocomplete Suggestions in Amazon CloudSearch

### Retrieving Data from Index Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

By default, the search results include all return enabled fields. To return a subset of the return
enabled fields or return expression values for the matching documents, you can specify the
```
return parameter. To return only the document IDs for the matching documents, specify
return=_no_fields. To retrieve the relevance score calculated for each document, specify
return=_score. You specify multiple return fields as a comma separated list. For example,
return=title,_score returns just the title and relevance score of each matching document.

```
Only fields configured to be return enabled can be included in the search results. Making fields
return enabled increases the size of your index, which can increase the cost of running your
domain. You should only store document data in the search index by making fields return enabled
when it's difficult or costly to retrieve the data using other means. Because it can take some time

Retrieving Data from Index Fields API Version 2013-01-01 159


-----

to apply document updates across the domain, you should retrieve critical data such as pricing
information by using the returned document IDs instead of returned from the index.

For example, to include the title and relevance _score in the search results, specify the following:
```
 search?q=star -wars&return=title,_score&size=3

```
The specified fields are included with each hit in the search results:
```
 {
  "status" : {
   "rid" : "y9Dzhs8oEwqMHnk=",
   "time-ms" : 2
  },
  "hits" : {
   "found" : 76,
   "start" : 0,
   "hit" : [ {
    "id" : "tt1411664",
    "fields" : {
     "title" : "Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star",
     "_score" : "9.231539"
    }
   }, {
    "id" : "tt1911658",
    "fields" : {
     "title" : "The Penguins of Madagascar",
     "_score" : "7.1051397"
    }
   }, {
    "id" : "tt0120601",
    "fields" : {
     "title" : "Being John Malkovich",
     "_score" : "6.206055"
    }
   } ]
  }
 }

### Getting Statistics for Numeric Fields in Amazon CloudSearch

```
Amazon CloudSearch can return the following statistics for facet-enabled numeric fields:

Getting Statistics for Numeric Fields API Version 2013-01-01 160


-----

- countâThe number of documents that contain a value in the specified field.

- maxâThe maximum value found in the specified field.

- meanâThe average of the values found in the specified field.

- minâThe minimum value found in the specified field.

- missingâThe number of documents that do not contain a value in the specified field.

- stddevâA measure to quantify the amount of deviation, or variation, in the field values. A low

standard deviation indicates that the values across all documents are close to the mean. A high
standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a large range. The standard
deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance, which is the average of the
squared differences from the mean.

- sumâThe sum of the field values across all documents.

- sumOfSquaresâThe sum of all field values squared.

To get statistics for a field you use the stats.FIELD parameter. FIELD is the name of a facet
enabled numeric field. You specify an empty JSON object, stats.FIELD={}, to get all of the

available statistics for the specified field. (The stats.FIELD parameter does not support any
options; you must pass an empty JSON object.) You can request statistics for multiple fields in the
same request.

You can get statistics only for facet-enabled numeric fields: date, date-array, double, double```
array, int, or int-array. Note that only the count, max, min, and missing statistics are

```
returned for date and date-array fields. For more information about enabling a field to return
facets, see configure indexing options.

For example, to search for star and get statistics for the year field, specify the following:
```
 search?q=star&stats.year={}

### Getting and Using Facet Information in Amazon CloudSearch

Getting and Using Facet Information API Version 2013-01-01 161


-----

A facet is an index field that represents a category that you want to use to refine and filter
search results. When you submit search requests to Amazon CloudSearch, you can request facet
information to find out how many documents share the same value in a particular field. You can
display this information along with the search results, and use it to enable users to interactively
refine their searches. (This is often referred to as faceted navigation or faceted search.)

You can get facet information for any facet-enabled field by specifying the facet.FIELD
parameter in your search request. By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns facet counts for the
top 10 values. For more information about enabling a field to return facets, see configure indexing

options. For a description of the facet.FIELD parameter, see Search Request Parameters in the
Search API reference.

You can specify facet options to control the sorting of the facet values for each field, limit the
number of facet values returned, or choose what facet values to count and return.

#### Getting Facet Information in Amazon CloudSearch

To get facet information for a field, you use the facet.FIELD parameter. FIELD is the name
of a facet-enabled field. You specify facet options as a JSON object. If the JSON object is empty

(facet.FIELD={}), facet counts are computed for all field values, the facets are sorted by facet
count, and the top 10 facets are returned in the results. You can request facet information for
multiple fields in the same request.

You can retrieve facet information in two ways:

- sortâReturns facet information sorted either by facet counts or facet values.

- bucketsâReturns facet information for particular facet values or ranges.

##### Sorting Facet Information

You specify the sort option to control how the facet information is sorted. There are two sort

options: count and bucket:

- Use count to sort the facets by facet counts. For example, facet.year={sort:'count'}

counts the number of matches that have the same year value and sorts the facet information by
that number.

- Use bucket to sort the facets by the facet values. For example,
```
 facet.year={sort:'bucket'} .

```
Getting Facet Information API Version 2013-01-01 162


-----

When you use the sort option, you can specify the size option to control the maximum number

of facet values returned in the results. The size option is valid only when you use the sort option.

In the following example, facet information is calculated for the genres field, the genres are
sorted by facet value, and the first 5 genres are returned in the results:
```
 facet.genres={sort:'bucket', size:5}

##### Bucketing Facet Information

```
You can explicitly specify the facet values or ranges that you want to count by using

the buckets option. Buckets are specified as an array of values or ranges, for example,
```
facet.color={buckets:["red","green","blue"]}.

```
To specify a range of values, use a comma (,) to separate the upper and lower bounds and

enclose the range using brackets or braces. A square bracket, [ or ], indicates that the bound
is included in the range, a curly brace, { or }, excludes the bound. You can omit the upper
or lower bound to specify an open-ended range. When omitting a bound, you must use a

curly brace. For example, facet.year={buckets:["[1970,1979]","[1980,1989]",
```
"[1990,1999]","[2000,2009]","[2010,}"]}. For a timestamp, you can use
q=-poet&facet.release_date={buckets:["[\'1980-01-01T00:00:00Z\',
\'1986-01-01T00:00:01Z\']"]}.

```
The sort and size options are not valid if you specify buckets.

Amazon CloudSearch supports two methods for calculating bucket counts, filter and interval.

By default, the filter method is used, which simply submits an additional filter query for each
bucket to get the bucket counts. While this works well in many cases, if you have a high update rate
or are retrieving a large number of facets, performance can suffer because those queries can't take
advantage of the internal caching mechanism.

If you're experiencing slow query performance for bucketed facets, try setting the buckets method

to interval, which post-processes the result set rather than submitting multiple queries:
```
 facet.year={buckets:["[1970,1979]","[1980,1989]","[1990,1999]"],method:"interval"}

```
We recommend doing your own performance testing to determine which method is best for your

application. In general, the filter method is faster if you have a fairly low update rate and aren't

retrieving a large number of buckets. However, if you have a high update rate or a lot of buckets,

using the interval method to post-process the result set can result in significantly faster query
performance.

#### Using Facet Information in Amazon CloudSearch

You can display facet information to enable users to more easily browse search results and identify
the information they are interested in. For example, if a user is trying to find one of the Star Trek
movies, but can't remember the full title, he might start by searching for star. If you want to

display top facets for genre, you would include facet.FIELD in the query, along with the number
of facet values that you want to retrieve for each facet:
```
 search?q=star&facet.genres={sort:'count',size:5}&format=xml&return=_no_fields

```
The preceding example gives you the following information in the search response:
```
 <results>
   <status rid="v7r9hs8oFQqMHnk=" time-ms="3"/>
   <hits found="85" start="0">
     <hit id="tt1411664"/>
     <hit id="tt1911658"/>
     <hit id="tt0086190"/>
     <hit id="tt0120601"/>
     <hit id="tt2141761"/>
     <hit id="tt1674771"/>
     <hit id="tt0056687"/>
     <hit id="tt0397892"/>
     <hit id="tt0258153"/>
     <hit id="tt0796366"/>
   </hits>
   <facets>
     <facet name="genres">
       <bucket value="Comedy" count="41"/><bucket value="Drama" count="35"/>
       <bucket value="Adventure" count="29"/>
       <bucket value="Sci-Fi" count="24"/>
       <bucket value="Action" count="20"/>
     </facet>
   </facets>
 </results>

```

##### Multi-Select Facets in Amazon CloudSearch

If you want to display the available facets and enable users to select multiple values to refine the
results, you can submit one request to get the documents that match the facet constraints and
additional requests to get the facet counts.

For example, in the sample movie data, the genres, rating, and year fields are facet enabled.
If the user searches for the term poet, you can submit the following request to get the matching

movies and the facet counts for the genres, rating, and year fields:
```
 q=poet&facet.genres={}&facet.rating={}&facet.year={}&return=_no_fields

```
Because no facet.FIELD options are specified, Amazon CloudSearch counts all of the facet values
and returns the top 10 values for each facet:
```
 {
  "status" : {
   "rid" : "it3T8tIoDgrUSvA=",
   "time-ms" : 5
  },
  "hits" : {

     {"value" : "6.2","count" : 2}, 
     {"value" : "7.1","count" : 2}, 
     {"value" : "7.9","count" : 2}, 
     {"value" : "5.3","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "6.1""count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "6.4","count" : 1},

     {"value" : "2008","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "2009","count" : 1} ]
  }
 }
}

```

When the user refines the search by selecting facet values, you use those facet selections to filter
the results. For example, if the user selects 2013, 2012, and 1993, the following request gets the
matching movies released during those years:
```
 q=poet&fq=(or year:2013 year:2012 year:1993)&facet.genres={}&facet.rating={}
 &facet.year={}&return=_no_fields

```

This gets the documents that match the user's selection and the facet counts with the filter
applied:

     {"value" : "5.3","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "6.2","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "6.4","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "7.1","count" : 1} ]
   },
   "year" : {
    "buckets" : [

 }
}

```

This is what you want to show for the genres and ratings. However, to enable the user to change
the year filter, you need to get the facet counts for the years that aren't selected. To do this, you
submit a second request to retrieve the facet counts for the year field without the filter:
```
 q=poet&facet.year={}&size=0

```
There's no need to retrieve the matching documents, so the size parameter is set to zero to

minimize the request latency. The request returns just the facet information for the year field:
```
 {
  "status" : {
   "rid" : "x/7r0NIoRwqlHfo=",
   "time-ms" : 4
  },
  "hits" : {
   "found" : 14,
   "start" : 0,
   "hit" : [ ]
  },
  "facets" : {
   "year" : {
    "buckets" : [ 
     {"value" : "2013","count" : 3}, 
     {"value" : "1993","count" : 2}, 
     {"value" : "1965","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "1989","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "1995","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "2001","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "2004","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "2006","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "2008","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "2009","count" : 1} ]
   }
  }
 }

```
To minimize the response time, you can send this request in parallel with the request to get the
filtered results. However, keep in mind that these additional requests can impact your overall query

performance, and it might be necessary to scale your domain up to handle the additional traffic.
(For more information about scaling, see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.)

If the user further refines the search by selecting a genre or rating, you add that to the filter criteria

to get the matching documents. For example, the following request gets the movies released in
2013, 2012, or 1993 that have a rating of 6.3:
```
 q=poet&fq=(and rating:6.3 (or year:2013 year:2012
 year:1993))&facet.genres={}&return=_no_fields

```
Getting the facet information for genres in this request returns the facet counts with the rating and
year filters applied:
```
 {
  "status" : {
   "rid" : "l66b89IoEArUSvA=",
   "time-ms" : 6
  },
  "hits" : {
   "found" : 2,
   "start" : 0,
   "hit" : [ 
    {"id" : "tt1462411"}, 
    {"id" : "tt0455323"} ]
  },
  "facets" : {
   "genres" : {
    "buckets" : [ 
     {"value" : "Drama","count" : 2} ]
   }
  }
 }

```
To enable the user to select a different rating, you submit an additional request to get the rating
facet counts with only the year filter applied:
```
 q=poet&fq=(or year:2013 year:2012 year:1993)&facet.rating={}&size=0

```
This request gets the following response:
```
 {

```

     {"value" : "6.4","count" : 1}, 
     {"value" : "7.1","count" : 1} ]

 }
}

### Highlighting Search Hits in Amazon CloudSearch

Amazon CloudSearch can return excerpts with the search results to show where the search terms
occur within a particular field of a matching document. For example, in the following excerpt the

search terms luke skywalker are highlighted within the plot field:
```
 highlights": {
   "plot": "After the rebels have been brutally overpowered by the Empire on
   their newly established base, *Luke* *Skywalker* takes advanced Jedi 
   training with Master Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader 
   as part of his plan to capture *Luke*."
 }

```
If you search for a phrase, the matching documents must contain that phrase. However, when you
retrieve highlights, the terms in the phrase are highlighted individually. If you search for the phrase
```
"Luke Skywalker" and retrieve highlights for the plot field as shown in the previous example,

```
the term Luke is highlighted even when it isn't followed by Skywalker. Highlights are returned
for the first 10 KB of data in a field. If the field contains more than 10 KB of data and the search
terms appear past the 10 KB limit, they are not highlighted.

You can get highlights for any highlight enabled field by specifying the highlight.FIELD

parameter in your search request. For example, to get highlights for the plot field shown, you
could specify the following:
```
 search?q=star wars&highlight.plot={}

```
For more information about enabling a field to return highlights, see configure indexing options.

You can control how many occurrences of the search term(s) within an excerpt are highlighted,
how they should be highlighted, and whether the excerpt is returned as plain text or HTML. When
Amazon CloudSearch returns excerpts as HTML, non-alphanumeric characters are escaped with
HTML entity encoding. This is done to minimize the risks associated with embedding untrusted
HTML content, since the field might have originally been populated with user-generated content.

Highlighting Search Hits API Version 2013-01-01 171


-----

You specify highlight options as a JSON object. If the JSON object is empty,
```
highlight.FIELD={}, Amazon CloudSearch highlights all occurrences of the search term(s) by

```
enclosing them in HTML emphasis tags, <em>term</em>, and the excerpts are returned as HTML.

- To specify whether the excerpt should be returned as text or html, use the format option; for

example, highlight.plot={format:'text'}.

- To specify the maximum number of occurrences of the search term(s) you want to highlight, use

the max_phrases option; for example, highlight.plot={max_phrases:3}. The default is 1,
the maximum is 5.

- To specify the string to prepend to each highlighted term, use the pre_tag option; for example,
```
 highlight.plot={pre_tag:'<strong>', post_tag:'</strong>'}.

```
- To specify the string to append to each highlighted term, use the post_tag option; for example,
```
 highlight.plot={pre_tag:'<strong>', post_tag:'</strong>'}.

### Getting Autocomplete Suggestions in Amazon CloudSearch

```
This section describes how to configure suggesters so you can retrieve suggestions. Suggestions are
possible matches for an incomplete search queryâthey enable you to display likely matches before
users finish typing their queries. In Amazon CloudSearch, suggestions are based on the contents
of a particular text field. When you request suggestions, Amazon CloudSearch finds all of the
documents whose values in the suggester field start with the specified query stringâthe beginning
of the field must match the query string to be considered a match. The return data includes the
field value and document ID for each match. You can configure suggesters to find matches for
the exact query string, or to perform approximate string matching (fuzzy matching) to correct for
typographical errors and misspellings.

For more information about the suggest API, see Suggest in the Search API.

- Retrieving Suggestions in Amazon CloudSearch

Getting Suggestions API Version 2013-01-01 172


-----

#### Configuring Suggesters for Amazon CloudSearch

When you configure a suggester, you must specify the name of the text field you want to search for
possible matches and a unique name for the suggester. Fields used for suggestions must be return
enabled. Only the first 512 bytes of data in the field are used to generate suggestions.

Suggester names must begin with a letter and be at least three and no more than 64 characters
long. The allowed characters are: a-z (lower-case letters), 0-9, and _ (underscore). The suggester
name is specified in the query string when you retrieve suggestions, so it's best to use short names.
The name score is reserved and cannot be used as a suggester name.

Suggesters also support two options:

- FuzzyMatchingâYou can set the level of fuzziness allowed when suggesting matches for a

string to none, low, or high. With none, the specified string is treated as an exact prefix. With
low, suggestions must differ from the specified string by no more than one character. With high,
suggestions can differ by up to two characters. The default is none.

- SortExpressionâYou can configure this expression to compute a score for each suggestion

to control how they are sorted. The scores are rounded to the nearest integer, with a floor
of 0 and a ceiling of 2^31-1. A document's relevance score is not computed for suggestions,

so sort expressions cannot reference the _score value. To sort suggestions using a numeric
field or existing expression, simply specify the name of the field or expression. If no expression
is configured for the suggester, the suggestions are sorted in alphabetical order. Note that
an expression defined within a suggester cannot be referenced in search requests or other
expressions. If want to use an expression for other purposes, add it to your domain configuration
and reference it by name from the suggester. For more information about expressions, see
Configuring Expressions.

If you want to get suggestions from multiple text fields, you define a suggester for each field
and submit separate suggestion requests to get matches from each suggester. You can configure
up to ten suggesters. Suggesters can consume significant amounts of memory and disk space,
particularly if you use text-heavy source fields and set fuzzy matching to high.

**Tip**

Instead of configuring suggesters to use all possibilities from all documents, consider
indexing the most popular 1,000 or 10,000 search queries and configuring suggesters to

Configuring Suggesters API Version 2013-01-01 173


-----

use those. You can store the queries in a separate Amazon CloudSearch index or in a field
used only for suggestions.


The easiest way to define suggesters is through the Suggesters page in the Amazon CloudSearch
console. You can also define suggesters using the AWS SDKs or AWS CLI.

**Important**

After you add a suggester to your search domain, you must run indexing before you can
use it to retrieve suggestions. As you add and delete documents, you must periodically
rebuild your index to update the suggestions. Suggestions won't reflect added or deleted

documents until you call IndexDocuments.

##### Configuring Suggesters through the Amazon CloudSearch Console

You can easily add, update, and delete suggesters through the Amazon CloudSearch console.

**To add a suggester**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In the left navigation pane, choose Domains.

3. Choose the name of the domain to open its configuration.

4. Go to the Advanced search options tab.

5. In the Suggesters pane, choose Add suggester.s

6. Enter a name for the new suggester.

7. For Source field, specify the text field to use for suggestions.

8. To include suggestions that correct for minor misspellings or typos, set Fuzzy matching to
**Low or High. When set to low, the suggestions include terms that differ from the user query**
string by a single character. When set to high, the suggestions include terms that differ by up
to two characters.

9. To control how the suggestions are sorted, enter a numeric expression in the Sort expression
field. The expression can simply be the name of the numeric field you want to use to sort the

Configuring Suggesters API Version 2013-01-01 174


-----

suggestions, the name of an existing expression, or any valid expression. For more information
about expressions, see Configuring Expressions.

10. Click Save changes.

11. When you're done configuring suggesters for your search domain, you must re-index your

domain before you can use the suggesters. To run indexing, go to the domain dashboard and
choose Actions, Run indexing.

##### Configuring Suggesters with the AWS CLI

You can add or update suggesters with the aws cloudsearch define-suggester command.

To remove a suggester, you use aws cloudsearch delete-suggester.

**To add or update a suggester**

- Run the aws cloudsearch define-suggester command. You specify the configuration

of the suggester in JSON with the --suggester option. The suggester configuration must be
enclosed in quotes and all quotes within the configuration must be escaped with a backslash.
[For the format of the suggester configuration, see define-suggester in the AWS CLI Command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudsearch/define-suggester.html)

Reference. For example, the following command configures a suggester called mysuggester

to return suggestions based on the title field.
```
   aws cloudsearch define-suggester --domain-name movies --suggester "{\"SuggesterName
   \": \"mysuggester\", \"DocumentSuggesterOptions\": {\"SourceField\":\"title\"}}"
   {
    "Suggester": {
     "Status": {
      "PendingDeletion": false,
      "State": "RequiresIndexDocuments",
      "CreationDate": "2014-06-26T17:26:43Z",
      "UpdateVersion": 27,
      "UpdateDate": "2014-06-26T17:26:43Z"
     },
     "Options": {
      "DocumentSuggesterOptions": {
       "SourceField": "title"
      },
      "SuggesterName": "mysuggester"
     }
    }

```
Configuring Suggesters API Version 2013-01-01 175


-----

```
}

```

You can use the --fuzzy-matching option to include suggestions that correct for minor

misspellings or typos. Valid values for fuzzy matching are none, low, and high. (The default

is none.) When set to low, the suggestions will include terms that differ from the user query

string by a single character. When set to high, the suggestions will include terms that differ

by up to two characters. For example, the following command configures mysuggester to
include suggestions that differ from the user query string by just one character:
```
   aws cloudsearch --name mysuggester --source title 
    --fuzzy-matching low

```
You can use the --sort-expression option to control how the returned suggestions are
sorted. You can use any valid expression for sorting. (Often, this will just be the name of a
numeric field or a predefined expression.) For example, to sort the suggestions returned by
```
  mysuggester according to the value in the year field, specify:
   aws cloudsearch define-suggester --name mysuggester --source title 
    --fuzzy-matching low --sort-expression year

```
**To delete a suggester**

- Run the aws cloudsearch delete-suggester command and specify the --name option.

For example, to delete mysuggester:
```
   aws cloudsearch delete-suggester --name mysuggester --delete

##### Configuring Suggesters Using the AWS SDKs

```
The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including DefineSuggester. For more
[information about installing and using the AWS SDKs, see AWS Software Development Kits.](http://aws.amazon.com/code)

#### Retrieving Suggestions in Amazon CloudSearch

You retrieve suggestions by sending requests to the suggest resource on a domain's search
endpoint via HTTP GET. For example:

Retrieving Suggestions API Version 2013-01-01 176


-----

```
http://search-movies-rr2f34ofg56xneuemujamut52i.us-east-1.cloudsearch.
amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/suggest?q=oce&suggester=mysuggester

```

You must specify the API version in the request and the query string must be URL-encoded.
The maximum size of a suggestion request is 8190 bytes, including the HTTP method, URI, and
protocol version.

The suggest resource supports four parameters:

- qâThe string that you want to get suggestions for.

- suggesterâThe name of the suggester you want to use.

- sizeâThe number of suggestions to retrieve. By default, the top ten suggestions are returned.

(The suggestions are sorted according the sort expression defined in the suggester. If no sort
expression is defined in the suggester, the suggestions are sorted in alphabetical order.)

- formatâThe content type of the response, json or xml. By default, suggestions are returned in

JSON.

The q and suggester parameters must be specified. No suggestions are returned if you request

suggestions for an empty string. The size and format parameters are optional.

The following example gets suggestions for the string oce based on the contents of the title
field.
```
 http://search-imdb2-m2brrr7ex7z6sqhgwsjdmcuvd4.us east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/suggest?q=oce&suggester=title

## Controlling How Search Results are Returned in Amazon CloudSearch

You can specify parameters in your search request to control how the search results are sorted,
return results in XML rather than JSON, and paginate through the result set. You can define
expressions that calculate a custom value that can be used to specify search constraints or sort
results.

**Topics**

### Sorting Results in Amazon CloudSearch

By default, search results are sorted according to their relevance to the search request. A

document's relevance score (_score) is based on how often the search terms appear in the
document compared to how common the term is across all documents in the domain. Relevance
scores are positive values that can vary widely depending on your data and queries. The scores
for each clause in your query are additive, so queries with more clauses will naturally have higher
scores than queries with just one or two. If you know what your typical queries will look like, you
can do some test queries to get an idea of the range of scores youâre likely to see.

To change how search results are sorted, you can:

- Use a text or literal field to sort results alphabetically. Note that Amazon CloudSearch

sorts by Unicode codepoint, so numbers come before letters and uppercase letters come before
lowercase letters. Numbers are sorted as strings, not by value; for example, 10 will come before
2.

- Use an int or double field to sort results numerically.

- Use a date field to sort results by date.

- Use a custom expression to sort results.

Sorting Results API Version 2013-01-01 179


-----

To use a field to sort the search results, you must configure the field to be SortEnabled. Only

single-value fields can be SortEnabledâyou cannot use the array-type fields for sorting. For

more information about configuring fields, see configure indexing options.

To use an expression for sorting, you construct a numeric expression using int fields, other
expressions, a document's relevance score, and numeric operators and functions. You can define
expressions in your domain configuration, or within a search request. For more information about
configuring expressions, see Configuring Expressions.

**Tip**

To sort results randomly, you can use a simple _rand expression:
```
    /2013-01-01/search?expr.r=_rand&q=test&return=r%2Cplot%2Ctitle&sort=r+desc

```
This expression is stable, which lets you page back and forth without losing the initial,

randomized sort. If you want to use a different randomized sort, you can add a-z and 0-9

characters after the _rand value, such as:
```
    /2013-01-01/search?expr.r=_rand1a2b3c&q=test&return=r%2Cplot%2Ctitle&sort=r+desc

```
You use the sort parameter to specify the field or expression you want to use to sort the results.
You must explicitly specify the sort direction along with the name of the field or expression. For

example, sort=year asc or sort=year desc.

When you use a field for sorting, documents without a value in that field are listed last. If you
specify a comma separated list of fields or expressions, the first field or expression is used as the
primary sort criteria, the second is used as the secondary sort criteria, and so on.

If you do not specify the sort parameter, the search results are ranked using the documents'
default relevance scores with the highest-scoring documents listed first. This is equivalent to

specifying sort=_score desc.

You can use the q.options parameter to specify field weights to apply when calculating a

document's relevance _score. For more information, see Using Relative Field Weighting to
Customize Text Relevance.

Sorting Results API Version 2013-01-01 180


-----

### Using Relative Field Weighting to Customize Relevance Ranking in Amazon CloudSearch

You can assign weights to selected fields so you can boost the relevance _score of documents

with matches in key fields such as a title field, and minimize the impact of matches in less
important fields. By default all fields have a weight of 1.

Field weights are set with the q.options `fields option. You specify fields as an array of strings.`

To set the weight for a field, you append a caret (^) and a positive numeric value to the field name.
You cannot set a field weight to zero or use mathematical functions or expressions to define a field
weight.

For example, if you want matches within the title field to score higher than matches within the
```
plot field, you could set the weight of the title field to 2 and the weight of the plot field to

```
0.5:
```
 q.options={fields:['title^2','plot^0.5']}

```
In addition to controlling field weights, the fields option defines the set of fields that are
searched by default if you use the simple query parser or don't specify a field in part of a
compound expression when using the structured query parser. For more information, see Search
Request Parameters in the Search API Reference.

To reference the weighted relevance score in the definition of an expression, you use _score. You

can use the weighted _score value in conjunction with numeric fields, other expressions, and the
standard numeric operators and functions. For more information, see Configuring Expressions.

### Configuring Expressions in Amazon CloudSearch

You can define numeric expressions and use them to sort search results. Expressions can also
be returned in search results. You can add expressions to the domain configuration or define
expressions within search requests.

- Comparing Expressions in Amazon CloudSearch

#### Writing Expressions for Amazon CloudSearch

Amazon CloudSearch expressions can contain:

- Single value, sort enabled numeric fields (int, double, date). (You must specify a specific field,

wildcards are not supported.)

- Other expressions

- The _score variable, which references a document's relevance score

- The _time variable, which references the current epoch time

- The _rand variable, which returns a randomly generated value

- Integer, floating point, hex, and octal literals

- Arithmetic operators: + - * / %

- Bitwise operators: | & ^ ~ << >> >>>

- Boolean operators (including the ternary operator): && || ! ?:

- Comparison operators: < <= == >= >

- Mathematical functions: abs ceil exp floor ln log10 logn max min pow sqrt

- Trigonometric functions: acos acosh asin asinh atan atan2 atanh cos cosh sin
```
 sinh tanh tan

```
- The haversin distance function

[JavaScript order of precedence rules apply for operators. You can override operator precedence by](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table)
using parentheses.

Shortcut evaluation is used when evaluating logical expressionsâif the value of the expression
can be determined after evaluating the first argument, the second argument is not evaluated. For

example, in the expression a || b, b is only evaluated if a is not true.

Expressions always return an integer value from 0 to the maximum 64-bit signed integer value
(2^63 - 1). Intermediate results are calculated as double-precision floating point values and the
return value is rounded to the nearest integer. If the expression is invalid or evaluates to a negative
value, it returns 0. If the expression evaluates to a value greater than the maximum, it returns the
maximum value.

Writing Expressions API Version 2013-01-01 182


-----

Expression names must begin with a letter and be at least 3 and no more than 64 characters long.
The following characters are allowed: a-z (lower-case letters), 0-9, and _ (underscore). The name
_score is reserved and cannot be used as an expression name._

For example, if you define an int field named popularity for your domain, you could use that field

in conjunction with the default relevance _score to construct a custom expression.
```
 (0.3*popularity)+(0.7*_score)

```
Note that this simple example assumes that the popularity ranking and the relevance _score values
are in about the same range. To tune your expressions for ranking results, you need to do some
testing to determine how to weight the components of your expressions to get the results you
want.

##### Using Date Fields in Amazon CloudSearch Expressions

The value from a date field is stored as an epoch time with millisecond resolution. This means you
can use the mathematical and comparison operators to construct expressions using dates stored in

your documents and the current epoch time (_time). For example, using the following expression
to sort search results from the movies domain pushes movies with recent release dates toward the
top of the list.
```
 _score/(_time - release_date)

#### Defining Amazon CloudSearch Expressions in Search Requests

```
You can define and use expressions directly within a search request so that you can iterate quickly
while you fine-tune expressions that you use to sort results. By defining an expression within a
search request, you can also incorporate contextual information into the expression, such as the
user's geographic location. You can override an expression defined in the domain configuration by
defining an expression with the same name within a search request.

When you define an expression within a search request, it is not stored as part of your domain
configuration. If you want to use the expression in other requests, you must define the expression
in each request or add the expression to your domain configuration. Defining an expression in
every request rather than adding it to the domain configuration increases the request overhead,
which can result in slower response times and potentially increase the cost of running your
domain. For information about adding expressions to the domain configuration, see Configuring
Expressions.

Defining Expressions in Search Requests API Version 2013-01-01 183


-----

You can define and use multiple expressions in a search request. The definition of an expression
can reference other expressions defined within the request, as well as expressions configured as
part of the domain configuration.

There are no restrictions on how you can use expressions that you define in a search request. You
can use the expression to sort the search results, define other expressions, or return computed
information in the search results.

**To define an expression in a search request**

1. Use the expr.NAME parameter, where NAME is the name of the expression you are defining.
For example:
```
   expr.rank1=log10(clicks)*_score

```
2. To use the expression to sort the results, specify the name of the expression with the sort
parameter:
```
   search?q=terminator&expr.rank1=log10(clicks)*_score&sort=rank1 desc

```
3. To include the computed value in the search results, add the expression to the list of return
fields:
```
   search?q=terminator&expr.rank1=log10(clicks)*_score&sort=rank1 desc&return=rank1

```
For example, the following request creates two expressions that are used to sort the results and
returns one of them in the search results:
```
 search?q=terminator&expr.rank1=sin( _score)&expression.rank2=cos( _score)&sort=rank1
 desc,rank2 desc&return=title,_score,rank2

#### Configuring Reusable Expressions for a Search Domain in Amazon CloudSearch

```
When you define an expression in a domain's configuration, you can reference the expression in
any search request. Adding an expression to the domain configuration reduces the overhead of
specifying it in every request, and helps maximize response times and minimize costs.

Configuring Reusable Expressions API Version 2013-01-01 184


-----

When you add an expression to your domain configuration, it takes some time for the change to
be processed and the new expression to become active. To quickly test changes to an expression,
you can define and use the expression directly in a search request, as described in query time
expressions. After you have finished testing and tuning an expression, you should add it to your
domain configuration.

select Insert to add special values and mathematical and trigonometric functions.

8. Choose Save.

##### Configuring Amazon CloudSearch Expressions Using the AWS CLI

You use the aws cloudsearch define-expression command to define computed expressions
for a domain.

**To configure an expression**

- Run the aws cloudsearch define-expression command to define a new expression.

You specify a name for the expression with the --name option, and the numeric expression

Configuring Reusable Expressions API Version 2013-01-01 185


-----

that you want to evaluate with the --expression option. For example, the following request

creates an expression called popularhits that takes into account a document's popularity

and relevance _score.
```
   aws cloudsearch define-expression --domain-name movies --name popularhits -   expression '((0.3*popularity)/10.0)+(0.7* _score)'
   {
     "Expression": {
       "Status": {
         "PendingDeletion": false, 
         "State": "Processing", 
         "CreationDate": "2014-05-01T01:15:18Z", 
         "UpdateVersion": 52,

         "ExpressionValue": "((0.3*popularity)/10.0)+(0.7* _score)"
       }
     }
   }

##### Configuring Expressions Using the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API

```
The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions

defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including DefineExpression. For more
[information about installing and using the AWS SDKs, see AWS Software Development Kits.](http://aws.amazon.com/code)

#### Comparing Expressions in Amazon CloudSearch

You can use the Amazon CloudSearch console to compare expressions and see how changes to the
expression and field weights affect how Amazon CloudSearch sorts search results.

**To compare expressions**

1. [Open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)
[home.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home)

2. In the left navigation pane, choose Domains.

3. Choose the name of the domain to open its configuration.

Comparing Expressions API Version 2013-01-01 186


-----

4. Choose Actions, Compare expressions.

5. In the Search box, enter the terms you want to search for. Amazon CloudSearch ranks the
search results using the specified expressions and weights. It refreshes the results whenever
you make changes to the expressions or weights.

6. In each expression editor, specify the rank expressions to compare. You can add new
expressions or select an existing expression from the Saved expressions menu. Amazon
CloudSearch evaluates new expressions when you submit a search request.

7. Specify the field weights to use for each expression. You can also edit the field weights directly
in the expression. Field weights must be in the range 0.0 to 10.0, inclusive. By default, the
weight for all fields is set to 1.0. You can set individual field weights to control how much
matches in particular text or literal fields affect a document's relevance _score. You can also
change the default weight.

**Note**

Adjusting field weights only affects result ranking if the expression references the
```
     _score value. You can modify the expression to change how the weight relevance
     _score contributes to a document's overall ranking. For more information, see Using

```
Relative Field Weighting to Customize Text Relevance.

8. Choose Run.

9. The search results for the two expressions are shown side-by-side. (If the expression is empty,

the results are sorted according to the default relevance _score.) Four icons highlight the
differences:

Green up arrow

The document is ranked higher in the search results using the second expression.

Red down arrow

The document is ranked lower in the search results using the second expression.

Comparing Expressions API Version 2013-01-01 187


-----

Yellow plus

The document is included in the search results using the second expression, but was
omitted from the search results using the first expression.

Red minus

The document was omitted from the search results using the second expression, but was
included in the search results using the first expression.

**Note**

You can save expressions to your domain configuration directly from the Compare
**expressions pane. To save either expression, choose Save expression.**

### Getting Results as XML in Amazon CloudSearch

By default, Amazon CloudSearch search responses are formatted in JSON. To get results as XML,

specify the query parameter format=xml in your search request:
```
 search?q=star wars&return=_no_fields&format=xml

```
Search responses formatted in XML contain exactly the same information as a JSON response:
```
 <results>
   <status rid="3abhhs8oEAqMHnk=" time-ms="2"/>
   <hits found="9" start="0">
     <hit id="tt0076759"/>
     <hit id="tt0086190"/>
     <hit id="tt0121766"/>
     <hit id="tt2488496"/>
     <hit id="tt1408101"/>
     <hit id="tt0489049"/>
     <hit id="tt0120915"/>
     <hit id="tt0080684"/>
     <hit id="tt0121765"/>

```

-----

```
  </hits>
</results>

```

For detailed information about the JSON and XML response formats for search requests, see Search
Response.

### Paginating Results in Amazon CloudSearch

By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns the top ten hits according to the specified sort order. To

control the number of hits returned in a result set, you use the size parameter.

To get the next set of hits beginning from a particular offset, you can use the start parameter.
Note that the result set is zero-basedâthe first result is at index 0. You can get the first 10,000 hits

using the size and start parameters. To page through more than 10,000 hits, use the cursor

parameter. For more information, see Deep Paging Beyond 10,000 Hits .

For example, search?q=wolverine returns the first 10 hits that contain wolverine, starting at

index 0. The following example sets the start parameter to 10 to get the next set of ten hits.
```
 search?q=wolverine&start=10

```
If you want to retrieve 25 hits at a time, set the size parameter to 25. To get the first set of hits,

you don't have to set the start parameter.
```
 search?q=wolverine&size=25

```
For subsequent requests, use the start parameter to retrieve the set of hits you want. For
example, to get the third batch of 25 hits, specify the following:
```
 search?q=wolverine&size=25&start=50

#### Deep Paging Beyond 10,000 Hits in Amazon CloudSearch

```
Using size and start to page through results works well if you only need to access the first few
pages of results. However, if you need to page through thousands of hits, using a cursor is more

efficient. To page through more than 10,000 hits, you must use a cursor. (You can only access the

first 10,000 hits using the start and size parameters.)

Paginating Results API Version 2013-01-01 189


-----

To page through results using a cursor, you specify cursor=initial in your initial search request

and include the size parameter to specify how many hits you want to get. Amazon CloudSearch

returns a cursor value in the response that you use to get the next set of hits. Cursors return
sequential sets of hits; however, you can use them to simulate random access of a deep page if

you need to. Keep in mind that cursors are intended to be used to page through a result set within
a reasonable amount of time of the initial request. Using a stale cursor can return stale results if
updates have been posted to the index in the interim.

**Important**

When you use a cursor to page through a result set that is sorted by document score

(_score), you can get inconsistent results if the index is updated between requests. This
can also occur if your domain's replication count is greater than one, because updates are
applied in an eventually consistent manner across the instances in the domain. If this is an

issue, avoid sorting the results by score. You can either use the sort option to sort by a

particular field, or use fq instead of q to specify your search criteria. (Document scores are
not calculated for filter queries.)

For example, the following request sets the cursor value to initial and the size parameter to
```
100 to get the first set of hits.
 search?q=-star&cursor=initial&size=100

```
The cursor for the next set of hits is included in the response.
```
 {
   "status": {
     "rid": "z67+3L0oHgo6swY=",
     "time-ms": 7
   },
   "hits": {
     "found": 1649,
     "start": 0,
      "cursor": "Vb-HSS4YQW9JSVFKeFpvQ2wwZERBek16SXpOems9Aw",
     "hit": [

## Integrating Amazon CloudSearch with API Gateway

This chapter provides information about integrating Amazon CloudSearch with Amazon API
Gateway. API Gateway lets you create and host REST APIs that make calls to other services. Some
use cases for using API Gateway with Amazon CloudSearch include the following:

- Further securing the Amazon CloudSearch search endpoint using API keys or Amazon Cognito

user pools

- Using CloudWatch to monitor and log search calls to the Amazon CloudSearch domain

- Restricting users to a more limited subset of the Amazon CloudSearch API

- Enforcing a rate limit on the number of requests

[To learn more about the benefits of API Gateway, see the API Gateway Developer Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/)

### Creating and Configuring an API (Console)

The steps involved in creating an API vary depending on whether the request uses parameters,
requires a request body, needs specific headers, and many other factors. The following procedure
creates an API that has one function: performing searches on an Amazon CloudSearch domain. For
[more complete information about configuring APIs, see Creating an API in Amazon API Gateway.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-api.html)

**To create an API (console)**

1. [Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and open the API Gateway console at https://](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)
[console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)

2. Choose Create API (or choose Get Started if this is your first time using API Gateway).

3. Choose Build under REST API (not private).

4. Provide a name and optional description, then choose Create API.

5. Choose Actions, Create Method. From the dropdown menu, choose GET and confirm.

6. For Integration type, choose AWS Service.

7. For AWS Region, choose the Region in which your Amazon CloudSearch domain resides.

8. For AWS Service, choose CloudSearch.

9. For AWS Subdomain, specify the subdomain for your Amazon CloudSearch domain's search
endpoint.

For example, if your domain's search endpoint is search-my-test```
  asdf5asdfasdfasdfasd5asdfg.us-west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com, specify
  search-my-test-asdf5ambgebbgmmodhhq5asdfg.

```
10. For HTTP Method, choose GET.

11. For Action Type, choose Use path override and enter /2013-01-01/search.

12. For Execution role, specify the ARN for my-api-gateway-role, such as
```
  arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-api-gateway-role.

```
13. For Content Handling, choose Passthrough, use the default timeout, and then choose Save.

14. Choose Method Request.

15. For Request Validator, choose Validate query string parameters and headers, and then

confirm.

16. Expand URL Query String Parameters. Choose Add query string, name the string q, and

confirm. Mark the query string as required.

-----

17. Choose Method Execution to return to the method summary.

18. Choose Integration Request.

19. Expand URL Query String Parameters. Choose Add query string, name the string q, provide a

mapping of method.request.querystring.q, and then confirm.

### Testing the API (Console)

At this point, you've created an API that has one method. Before deploying the API, you should test
it.

**To test the API (console)**

1. Navigate to the Method Execution page.

2. Choose Test.

3. Under Query Strings, enter a query string that will match some data in the Amazon

CloudSearch domain. If you are using the IMDb movie data, try q=thor.

4. Choose Test.

5. Verify that the response body contains search results, such as the following:
```
   {
    "status": {
     "rid": "rcWTo8IsviEK+own",
     "time-ms": 1
    },
    "hits": {
     "found": 7,
     "start": 0,
     "hit": [
      {
       "id": "tt0800369",
       "fields": {
        "rating": "7.0",
        "genres": [
         "Action",
         "Adventure",
         "Fantasy"
        ],
        "title": "Thor",
        "release_date": "2011-04-21T00:00:00Z",

```
Testing the API (Console) API Version 2013-01-01 196


-----

```
     "plot": "The powerful but arrogant god Thor is cast out of Asgard to
 live amongst humans in Midgard (Earth), where he soon becomes one of their finest
 defenders.",
     "rank": "135",
     "running_time_secs": "6900",
     "directors": [
      "Kenneth Branagh",
      "Joss Whedon"
     ],
     "image_url": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/
MV5BMTYxMjA5NDMzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk2Mjk3NA@@._V1_SX400_.jpg",
     "year": "2011",
     "actors": [

      "Anthony Hopkins",
      "Natalie Portman"
     ]
    }
   },
    ...
  ]
 }
}

```

At this point, you have a functional API. You can add methods to enable more robust search
requests, deploy the API and configure rate limiting, create and require the use of API keys, add
[Amazon Cognito user pool authentication, and much more. For more information, see the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/)

## Handling Errors in Amazon CloudSearch

This section provides information about how to handle errors when interacting with Amazon
CloudSearch programmatically. For information about specific error codes returned by the Amazon

CloudSearch services, see:

- Search Service Errors

- documents/batch Status Codes

- Configuration Service Common Errors. For the specific errors that can be returned from a

particular action, see the documentation for that action.

**Topics**

- Error Types in Amazon CloudSearch

- Retrying Requests in Amazon CloudSearch

### Error Types in Amazon CloudSearch

The HTTP status codes returned by the Amazon CloudSearch APIs indicate whether the request
completed successfully, or if a client or server error occurred while processing the request:

- 2xx status codes indicate that the client request was processed successfully.

- 4xx status codes indicate that there was a problem with the client request. Common client

request errors include providing invalid credentials and omitting required parameters. When you
get a 4xx error, you need to correct the problem and resubmit a properly formed client request.

- 5xx status codes indicate that a server error occurred while processing the client request. Server

errors are typically transient and are often the result of server timeouts, throttling, or capacity
limitations. We recommend catching and retrying all 5xx errors.

An HTTP status code is returned for every request. In addition, the body of the response provides
additional warning and error information.

Messages in a search response indicate the severity level, the warning or error code, and a
description of the problem with the search request. For a list of the warnings and errors that can
be returned by the search service, see Search Response Properties (JSON) or Search Response
Elements (XML).

Error Types in Amazon CloudSearch API Version 2013-01-01 198


-----

Errors and warnings in a documents/batch response provide information about parsing and
validation issues encountered while processing the document data. For more information, see
documents/batch Response (JSON) or documents/batch Response (XML).

Errors returned in a configuration service response provide information about what caused
the request to return a 4xx or 5xx status code. For information about the common errors that
all actions use, see Common Errors. Action-specific errors are listed in the action topics in the
Configuration API Reference for Amazon CloudSearch .

### Retrying Requests in Amazon CloudSearch

For your application to run smoothly, you need to build in logic to catch and respond to errors. One
typical approach is to implement your request within a try block or if-then statement.

We recommend catching and retrying all server errors (5xx). Because errors can be generated from
anywhere within the request pipeline, you should implement a fallback for unexpected 5xx errors
in addition to any special handling for specific status codes.

507 and 509 errors typically indicate that your search service is overloaded. This can be due to the
volume or complexity of search requests that you are submitting. Amazon CloudSearch normally
scales automatically to handle the load. Because it takes some time to deploy additional search
instances, we recommend using an exponential backoff retry policy to temporarily reduce the
[request rate and minimize request failures. For more information, see Error Retries and Exponential](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html)
[Backoff.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html)

Certain usage patterns, such as submitting complex search queries to a single small search
instance, can sometimes result in timeouts without triggering automatic scaling. If you repeatedly
experience a high error rate, you can explicitly request additional capacity through the Amazon
[CloudSearch Service Limit Request form.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudsearch-partitions-and-instances)

Client errors (4xx) typically indicate that you need to revise the request to correct the problemâ
simply retrying the same request will most likely result in the same error. 409 errors returned by
the configuration service can indicate that the request was rejected because a resource limit has
been reached. For more information, see Limits.

Retrying Requests in Amazon CloudSearch API Version 2013-01-01 199

## Amazon CloudSearch API Reference

You use three APIs to interact with Amazon CloudSearch:

- Configuration APIâSet up and manage your search domain.

- Document Service APIâSubmit the data you want to search.

- Search APIâSearch your domain.

### Configuration API Reference for Amazon CloudSearch

You use the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API to create, configure, and manage search
domains. For more information configuring search domains, see Creating and Managing Search
Domains.

The other APIs you use to interact with Amazon CloudSearch are:

- Document Service APIâSubmit the data you want to search.

- Search APIâSearch your domain.

#### Submitting Configuration Requests in Amazon CloudSearch

**Important**

The easiest way to submit configuration requests is to use the Amazon CloudSearch
console, Amazon CloudSearch command line tools, or the AWS SDK for Java,
JavaScript, .NET, PHP, Ruby, or Python (Boto). The command line tools and SDKs handle

Configuration API Reference API Version 2013-01-01 200


-----

the signing process for you and ensure that Amazon CloudSearch configuration requests
[are properly formed. For more information about the AWS SDKs, see AWS Software](http://aws.amazon.com/code)
[Development Kits.](http://aws.amazon.com/code)


You submit Amazon CloudSearch configuration requests to the Amazon CloudSearch endpoint for
your region using the AWS Query protocol. For the current list of supported regions and endpoints,
[see Regions and Endpoints.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloudsearch_region)

AWS Query requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests submitted via HTTP GET or POST with a Query
parameter named Action. You must specify the API version in all configuration requests and that
version must match the API version specified when the domain was created.

You must include authorization parameters and a digital signature in every request. Amazon
[CloudSearch supports AWS Signature Version 4. For detailed signing instructions, see Signature V4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
[Signing Process in the AWS General Reference.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)

**Note**

Amazon CloudSearch throttles excessive requests to the configuration service. Throttling

occurs by action, so excessive DescribeDomains requests don't cause Amazon

CloudSearch to throttle DescribeIndexFields requests. The request limit changes
based on the needs of the service, but allows many calls to each action per hour.

##### Structure of a Configuration Request

This reference shows Amazon CloudSearch configuration requests as URLs, which can be used
directly in a browser. (Although the GET requests are shown as URLs, the parameter values are
shown unencoded to make them easier to read. Keep in mind that you must URL encode parameter
values when submitting requests.) The URL contains three parts:

- Endpointâthe Web service entry point to act on, cloudsearch.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.

- Actionâthe Amazon CloudSearch configuration action you want to perform. For a complete list

of actions, see Actions.

- Parametersâany request parameters required for the specified action. Each query request must

also include some common parameters to handle authentication. For more information, see
Request Authentication.

Submitting Configuration Requests API Version 2013-01-01 201


-----

You must specify the Version parameter in every Amazon CloudSearch configuration request. The
current Amazon CloudSearch API version is 2013-01-01.

For example, the following GET request creates a new search domain called movies:
```
 https://cloudsearch.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
 ?Action=CreateDomain
 &DomainName=movies
 &Version=2013-01-01
 &X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
 &X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE/20120712/us-east-1/cloudsearch/aws4
 _request
 &X-Amz-Date=2012-07-12T21:41:29.094Z
 &X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host
 &X-Amz-Signature=c7600a00fea082dac002b247f9d6812f25195fbaf7f0a6fc4ce08a39666c6a10
 3c8dcb

##### Request Authentication

```
Requests submitted to the Configuration API are authenticated using your AWS access keys.
You must include authorization parameters and a digital signature in every request. Amazon
[CloudSearch supports AWS Signature Version 4. For detailed signing instructions, see Signature V4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
[Signing Process in the AWS General Reference.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)

**Note**

If you are just getting started signing your own AWS requests, take a look at how the
[SDKs implement signing. The source for most of the AWS SDKs is available at https://](https://github.com/aws)
[github.com/aws.](https://github.com/aws)

For example, to construct a CreateDomain request, you need the following information:
```
 Region name: us-east-1
 Service name: cloudsearch
 API version: 2013-01-01
 Date: 2014-03-12T21:41:29.094Z
 Access key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
 Secret key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
 Action: CreateDomain

```
Submitting Configuration Requests API Version 2013-01-01 202


-----

```
Action Parameters: DomainName=movies

```

The canonical query string for a CreateDomain request looks like this:
```
 Action=CreateDomain
 &DomainName=movies
 &Version=2013-01-01
 &X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
 &X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE/20120712/us-east-1/cloudsearch/aws4
 _request
 &X-Amz-Date=2012-07-12T21:41:29.094Z
 &X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host

```
The final signed request looks like this:
```
 https://cloudsearch.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
 ?Action=CreateDomain
 &DomainName=movies
 &Version=2013-01-01
 &X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
 &X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE/20120712/us-east-1/cloudsearch/aws4
 _request

### Document Service API Reference for Amazon CloudSearch

You use the document service API to add, replace, or delete documents in your Amazon
CloudSearch domain. For more information managing the documents in your search domain, see
upload documents.

The other APIs you use to interact with Amazon CloudSearch are:

Document Service API Reference API Version 2013-01-01 306


-----

- Configuration API Reference for Amazon CloudSearch âSet up and manage your search domain.

- Search APIâSearch your domain.

#### documents/batch

This section describes the HTTP request and response messages for the documents/batch
resource.

You create document batches to describe the data that you want to upload to an Amazon
CloudSearch domain. A document batch is a collection of add and delete operations that represent
the documents you want to add, update, or delete from your domain. Batches can be described
in either JSON or XML. A batch provides all of the information Amazon CloudSearch needs for
indexing. Each item that you want to be able to return as a search result (such as a product) is
represented as a documentâa batch is simply a collection of add and delete requests for individual
documents. Every document has a unique ID and one or more fields that contain the data that you
want to search and return in results.

To update a document, you specify an add request with the document ID of the document
you want to update. For more information, see Adding and Updating Documents in Amazon
CloudSearch. Similarly, to delete a document, you submit a delete request with the document
ID of the document you want to delete. For information about deleting documents, see Deleting
Documents in Amazon CloudSearch.

For more information about submitting data for indexing, see upload documents.

##### documents/batch JSON API

**JSON documents/batch Requests**

The body of a documents/batch request uses JSON or XML to specify the document operations
you want to perform. A JSON representation of a batch is a collection of objects that define

individual add and delete operations. The type property identifies whether an object represents an
add or delete operation. For example, the following JSON batch adds one document and deletes
one document:
```
 [
 { "type": "add",
  "id":  "tt0484562",
  "fields": {

```

-----

##### Search Request Parameters

cursor

Retrieves a cursor value you can use to page through large result sets. Use the size parameter
to control the number of hits you want to include in each response. You can specify either the
```
  cursor or start parameter in a request, they are mutually exclusive. For more information,

```
see Paginate the results.

To get the first cursor, specify cursor=initial in your initial request. In subsequent requests,
specify the cursor value returned in the hits section of the response.

For example, the following request sets the cursor value to initial and the size parameter
to 100 to get the first set of hits. The cursor for the next set of hits is included in the response.
```
   search?q=john&cursor=initial&size=100&return=_no_fields
   {
    "status": {
      "rid": "+/Xu5s0oHwojC6o=",
      "time-ms": 15
    },
    "hits": {
      "found": 503,
      "start": 0,
      "cursor": "VegKzpYYQW9JSVFFRU1UeWwwZERBd09EUTNPRGM9ZA",
      "hit": [
       {"id": "tt0120601"},
       {"id": "tt1801552"},
       ...
      ]
    }
   }

```
To get the next set of hits, you specify the cursor value and the number of hits to retrieve.
```
   search?q=john&cursor=VegKzpYYQW9JSVFFRU1UeWwwZERBd09EUTNPRGM9ZA&size=100

```
Type: String

Required: No

Search API Version 2013-01-01 320


-----

expr.NAME

Defines an expression that can be used to sort results. You can also specify an expression as
a return field. For more information about defining and using expressions, see Configuring
Expressions.

You can define and use multiple expressions in a search request. For example, the following
request creates two expressions that are used to sort the results and includes them in the
search results:
```
   search?q=(and (term field=genres 'Sci-Fi')(term field=genres
   'Comedy'))&q.parser=structured
   &expr.expression1=_score*rating
   &expr.expression2=(1/rank)*year
   &sort=expression1 desc,expression2 desc
   &return=title,rating,rank,year,_score,expression1,expression2

```
Type: String

Required: No

facet.FIELD

Specifies a field that you want to get facet information forâFIELD is the name of the field. The
specified field must be facet enabled in the domain configuration. Facet options are specified as

a JSON object. If the JSON object is empty, facet.FIELD={}, facet counts are computed for
all field values, the facets are sorted by facet count, and the top 10 facets are returned in the
results.

You can specify three options in the JSON object:

  - sort specifies how you want to sort the facets in the results: bucket or count. Specify
```
   bucket to sort alphabetically or numerically by facet value (in ascending order). Specify
   count to sort by the facet counts computed for each facet value (in descending order).

```
To retrieve facet counts for particular values or ranges of values, use the buckets option

instead of sort.

  - buckets specifies an array of the facet values or ranges you want to count. Buckets are

returned in the order they are specified in the request. To specify a range of values, use a
comma (,) to separate the upper and lower bounds and enclose the range using brackets
or braces. A square bracket, [ or ], indicates that the bound is included in the range, a curly

Search API Version 2013-01-01 321


-----

brace, { or }, excludes the bound. You can omit the upper or lower bound to specify an open
ended range. When omitting a bound, you must use a curly brace. The sort and size

options are not valid if you specify buckets.

  - size specifies the maximum number of facets to include in the results. By default, Amazon

CloudSearch returns counts for the top 10. The size parameter is only valid when you

specify the sort option; it cannot be used in conjunction with buckets.

For example, the following request gets facet counts for the year field, sorts the facet counts
by value and returns counts for the top three:
```
   facet.year={sort:"bucket", size:3}

```
To specify which values or range of values you want to calculate facet counts for, use the
```
  buckets option. For example, the following request calculates and returns the facet counts by

```
decade:
```
   facet.year={buckets:["[1970,1979]","[1980,1989]",
         "[1990,1999]","[2000,2009]",
         "[2010,}"]}

```
You can also specify individual values as buckets:
```
   facet.genres={buckets:["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"]}

```
Note that the facet values are case-sensitiveâwith the sample IMDb movie data, if you specify
```
  ["action","adventure","sci-fi"] instead of ["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],

```
all facet counts are zero.

Type: String

Required: No

format

Specifies the content type of the response.

Type: String

Valid Values: json|xml

Search API Version 2013-01-01 322


-----

fq


Default: json

Required: No

Specifies a structured query that filters the results of a search without affecting how the results

are scored and sorted. You use fq in conjunction with the q parameter to filter the documents

that match the constraints specified in the q parameter. Specifying a filter just controls which
matching documents are included in the results, it has no effect on how they are scored and

sorted. The fq parameter supports the full structured query syntax. For more information
about using filters, see Filtering Matching Documents. For more information about structured
queries, see Structured Search Syntax.

Type: String

Required: No


highlight.FIELD

Retrieves highlights for matches in the specified text or text-array field. Highlight options
are specified as a JSON object. If the JSON object is empty, the returned field text is treated as

HTML and the first match is highlighted with emphasis tags: <em>search-term</em>.

You can specify four options in the JSON object:

  - formatâspecifies the format of the data in the text field: text or html. When data is

returned as HTML, all non-alphanumeric characters are encoded. The default is html.

  - max_phrasesâspecifies the maximum number of occurrences of the search term(s) you

want to highlight. By default, the first occurrence is highlighted.

  - pre_tagâspecifies the string to prepend to an occurrence of a search term. The default for

HTML highlights is <em>. The default for text highlights is *.

  - post_tagâspecifies the string to append to an occurrence of a search term. The default for

HTML highlights is </em>. The default for text highlights is *.

Examples: highlight.plot={},
```
  highlight.plot={format:'text',max_phrases:2,pre_tag:'<b>',post_tag:'</
  b>'}

```
Type: String

Search API Version 2013-01-01 323


-----

Required: No

partial

Controls whether partial results are returned if one or more index partitions are unavailable.
When your search index is partitioned across multiple search instances, by default Amazon
CloudSearch only returns results if every partition can be queried. This means that the
failure of a single search instance can result in 5xx (internal server) errors. When you specify
```
  partial=true. Amazon CloudSearch returns whatever results are available and includes

```
the percentage of documents searched in the search results (percent-searched). This
enables you to more gracefully degrade your users' search experience. For example, rather than
displaying no results, you could display the partial results and a message indicating that the
results might be incomplete due to a temporary system outage.

Type: Boolean

Default: False

Required: No

pretty

Formats JSON output so it's easier to read.

Type: Boolean

Default: False

Required: No

q

The search criteria for the request. How you specify the search criteria depends on the query

parser used for the request and the parser options specified in the q.options parameter. By

default, the simple query parser is used to process requests. To use the structured, lucene,

or dismax query parser, you must also specify the q.parser parameter. For more information
about specifying search criteria, see Searching Your Data with Amazon CloudSearch.

Type: String

Required: Yes

Search API Version 2013-01-01 324


-----

q.options

Configure options for the query parser specified in the q.parser parameter. The options are

specified as a JSON object, for example: q.options={defaultOperator: 'or', fields:
```
  ['title^5','description']}.

```
The options you can configure vary according to which parser you use:

  - defaultOperatorâThe default operator used to combine individual terms in the search

string. For example: defaultOperator: 'or'. For the dismax parser, you specify a
percentage that represents the percentage of terms in the search string (rounded down) that

must match, rather than a default operator. A value of 0% is the equivalent to OR, and a value

of 100% is equivalent to AND. The percentage must be specified as a value in the range 0-100

followed by the percent (%) symbol. For example, defaultOperator: 50%. Valid values:
```
   and, or, a percentage in the range 0%-100% (dismax). Default: and (simple, structured,
   lucene) or 100 (dismax). Valid for: simple, structured, lucene, and dismax.

```
  - fieldsâAn array of the fields to search when no fields are specified in a search. If no

fields are specified in a search and this option is not specified, all statically configured text

and text-array fields are searched. You can specify a weight for each field to control
the relative importance of each field when Amazon CloudSearch calculates relevance

scores. To specify a field weight, append a caret (^) symbol and the weight to the field

name. For example, to boost the importance of the title field over the description

field you could specify: fields: ['title^5','description']. Valid values: The
name of any configured field and an optional numeric value greater than zero. Default: All

statically configured text and text-array fields. Dynamic fields and literal fields are

not searched by default. Valid for: simple, structured, lucene, and dismax.

  - operatorsâAn array of the operators or special characters you want to disable for

the simple query parser. If you disable the and, or, or not operators, the corresponding

operators (+, |, -) have no special meaning and are dropped from the search string. Similarly,

disabling prefix disables the wildcard operator (*) and disabling phrase disables the
ability to search for phrases by enclosing phrases in double quotes. Disabling precedence

disables the ability to control order of precedence using parentheses. Disabling near disables

the ability to use the ~ operator to perform a sloppy phrase search. Disabling the fuzzy

operator disables the ability to use the ~ operator to perform a fuzzy search. escape

disables the ability to use a backslash (\) to escape special characters within the search string.
Disabling whitespace is an advanced option that prevents the parser from tokenizing on
whitespace, which can be useful for Vietnamese. (It prevents Vietnamese words from being

Search API Version 2013-01-01 325


-----

split incorrectly.) For example, you could disable all operators other than the phrase operator

to support just simple term and phrase queries: operators:['and', 'not', 'or',
```
   'prefix']. Valid values: and, escape, fuzzy, near, not, or, phrase, precedence,
   prefix, whitespace. Default: All operators and special characters are enabled. Valid for:
   simple.

```
  - phraseFieldsâAn array of the text or text-array fields you want to use for phrase

searches. When the terms in the search string appear in close proximity within a field,
the field scores higher. You can specify a weight for each field to boost that score. The
```
   phraseSlop option controls how much the matches can deviate from the search string and

```
still be boosted. To specify a field weight, append a caret (^) symbol and the weight to the

field name. For example, to boost phrase matches in the title field over the abstract

field, you could specify: phraseFields:['title^3', 'abstract'] Valid values: The

name of any text or text-array field and an optional numeric value greater than zero.

Default: No fields. If you don't specify any fields with phraseFields, proximity scoring is

disabled even if phraseSlop is specified. Valid for: dismax.

  - phraseSlopâAn integer value that specifies how much matches can deviate from the

search phrase and still be boosted according to the weights specified in the phraseFields

option. For example, phraseSlop: 2. You must also specify phraseFields to enable

proximity scoring. Valid values: positive integers. Default: 0. Valid for: dismax.

  - explicitPhraseSlopâAn integer value that specifies how much a match can deviate from

the search phrase when the phrase is enclosed in double quotes in the search string. (Phrases

that exceed this proximity distance are not considered a match.) explicitPhraseSlop: 5.

Valid values: positive integers. Default: 0. Valid for: dismax.

  - tieBreakerâWhen a term in the search string is found in a document's field, a score

is calculated for that field based on how common the word is in that field compared to
other documents. If the term occurs in multiple fields within a document, by default only
the highest scoring field contributes to the document's overall score. You can specify a
```
   tieBreaker value to enable the matches in lower-scoring fields to contribute to the

```
document's score. That way, if two documents have the same max field score for a particular
term, the score for the document that has matches in more fields will be higher. The formula
for calculating the score with a tieBreaker is:
```
    (max field score) + (tieBreaker) * (sum of the scores for the rest of the matching
    fields)

```
Search API Version 2013-01-01 326


-----

For example, the following query searches for the term dog in the title, description, and
```
   review fields and sets tieBreaker to 0.1:
    q=dog&q.parser=dismax&q.options={fields:['title', 'description', 'review'],
    tieBreaker: 0.1}

```
If dog occurs in all three fields of a document and the scores for each field are title=1,
description=3, and review=1, the overall score for the term dog is:
```
    3 + 0.1 * (1+1) = 3.2

```
Set tieBreaker to 0 to disregard all but the highest scoring field (pure max). Set to 1 to sum

the scores from all fields (pure sum). Valid values: 0.0 to 1.0. Default: 0.0. Valid for: dismax.

Type: JSON object

Default: See individual option descriptions.

Required: No

q.parser

Specifies which query parser to use to process the request: simple, structured, lucene, and
```
  dismax. If q.parser is not specified, Amazon CloudSearch uses the simple query parser.

```
  - simpleâperform simple searches of text and text-array fields. By default, the simple

query parser searches all statically configured text and text-array fields. You can specify

which fields to search by with the q.options parameter. If you prefix a search term with a
plus sign (+) documents must contain the term to be considered a match. (This is the default,

unless you configure the default operator with the q.options parameter.) You can use the 
(NOT), | (OR), and * (wildcard) operators to exclude particular terms, find results that match
any of the specified terms, or search for a prefix. To search for a phrase rather than individual
terms, enclose the phrase in double quotes. For more information, see Searching Your Data
with Amazon CloudSearch.

  - structuredâperform advanced searches by combining multiple expressions to define the

search criteria. You can also search within particular fields, search for values and ranges of

values, and use advanced options such as term boosting, matchall, and near. For more
information, see Constructing Compound Queries.

Search API Version 2013-01-01 327


-----

  - luceneâsearch using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax. For more information, see

[Apache Lucene Query Parser Syntax.](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Standard+Query+Parser)

  - dismaxâsearch using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene query parser syntax

[defined by the DisMax query parser. For more information, see DisMax Query Parser Syntax.](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+DisMax+Query+Parser)

Type: String

Default: simple

Required: No

return

The field and expression values to include in the response, specified as a comma-separated

list. By default, a search response includes all return enabled fields (return=_all_fields).

To return only the document IDs for the matching documents, specify return=_no_fields.

To retrieve the relevance score calculated for each document, specify return=_score. You

specify multiple return fields as a comma separated list. For example, return=title,_score
returns just the title and relevance score of each matching document.

Type: String

Required: No

size

The maximum number of search hits to return.

Type: Positive integer

Default: 10

Required: No

sort

A comma-separated list of fields or custom expressions to use to sort the search results.

You must specify the sort direction (asc or desc) for each field. For example, sort=year
```
  desc,title asc. You can specify a maximum of 10 fields and expressions. To use a field to

```
sort results, it must be sort enabled in the domain configuration. Array type fields cannot be

used for sorting. If no sort parameter is specified, results are sorted by their default relevance

Search API Version 2013-01-01 328


-----

scores in descending order: sort=_score desc. You can also sort by document ID (sort=_id)

and version (sort=_version).

Type: String

Required: No

start

The offset of the first search hit you want to return. You can specify either the start or
```
  cursor parameter in a request, they are mutually exclusive. For more information, see Paginate

```
the results.

Type: Positive integer

Default: 0 (the first hit)

Required: No

**Structured Search Syntax**

You use the Amazon CloudSearch structured search syntax to define search criteria when using the
```
structured query parser, and to specify filter criteria with the fq parameter.

```
When using the structured query operators, you specify the name of the operator, options

for the operator, and then the terms being operated on, (OPERATOR OPTIONS STRING|
```
EXPRESSION). Any options must be specified before the string or expression. For example, (and
(not field=genres 'Sci-Fi')(or (term field=title boost=2 'star')(term
field=plot 'star'))).

```
**Important**

You must URL-encode special characters in the query string. For example, you must encode

the = operator in a structured query as %3D: (term+field%3Dtitle+'star'). Amazon

CloudSearch returns an InvalidQueryString error if special characters are not URL[encoded. For a complete reference of URL-encodings, see the W3C HTML URL Encoding](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)
[Reference.](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)

If you do not specify the field you want to search when using the structured query parser, all

statically configured text and text-array fields are searched. Dynamic fields and literal

Search API Version 2013-01-01 329


-----

fields are not searched by default. You can specify which fields you want to search by default with

the q.options parameter.

Parentheses control the order of evaluation of the expressions in a compound query. When an
expression is enclosed in parentheses, that expression is evaluated first, and then the resulting
value is used in the evaluation of the remainder of the query. The expressions can contain any of
the structured query operators.

You can also use the structured query parser to search for a simple text stringâjust enclose the

string you want to search for in single quotes: q='black swan'&q.parser="structured".

For more information about constructing compound queries with the structured query operators,
see Constructing Compound Queries.

FIELD

Syntax: FIELD: 'STRING'|value

Searches the specified field for a string, numeric value, date, or range of numeric values or
dates.

Strings must be enclosed in single quotes. Any single quotation marks or backslashes in the
string must be escaped with a backslash. To specify a range of values, use a comma (,) to
separate the upper and lower bounds and enclose the range using brackets or braces. A square
bracket, [ or ], indicates that the bound is included in the range, a curly brace, { or }, excludes
the bound. You can omit the upper or lower bound to specify an open-ended range. When
omitting a bound, you must use a curly brace.

[Dates and times are specified in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) according to IETF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)

[RFC3339: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ. In UTC, for example, 5:00 PM August 23, 1970 is:](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
```
  1970-08-23T17:00:00Z. Note that you can also specify fractional seconds when specifying

```
times in UTC. For example, 1967-01-31T23:20:50.650Z.

Examples:
```
   title:'star'
   year:2000
   year:[1998,2000]
   year:{,2011]
   release_date:['2013-01-01T00:00:00Z',}

```
Search API Version 2013-01-01 330


-----

and

Syntax: (and boost=N EXPRESSION EXPRESSION ... EXPRESSIONn)

Includes a document only if it matches all of the specified expressions.(Boolean AND operator.)

The expressions can contain any of the structured query operators, or a simple search string.
Search strings must be enclosed in single quotes. Note that to match documents that contain
the specified terms in any of the fields being searched, you specify each term as a separate

expression: (and 'star' 'wars'). If you specify (and 'star wars'), star and wars must
occur within the same field to be considered a match.

The boost value is a positive numeric value that increases the importance of this part of the
search query relative to the other parts.

Example:
```
   (and title:'star' actors:'Harrison Ford' year:{,2000])

```
matchall

Syntax: matchall

Matches every document in the domain. By default, returns the first 10. Use the size and
```
  start parameters to page through the results.

```
near

Syntax: (near field=FIELD distance=N boost=N 'STRING')

Searches a text or text-array field for the specified multi-term string and matches
documents that contain the terms within the specified distance of one another. (This is

sometimes called a sloppy phrase search.) If you omit the field option, Amazon CloudSearch

searches all statically configured text and text-array fields by default. Dynamic fields and
```
  literal fields are not searched by default. You can specify which fields you want to search by

```
default by specifying the q.options `fields option.`

The distance value must be a positive integer. For example, to find all documents where teenage

occurs within 10 words of vampire in the plot field, you specify a distance value of 10: (near
```
  field=plot distance=10 'teenage vampire').

```
The boost value is a positive numeric value that increases the importance of this part of the
search query relative to the other parts.

-----

Example:
```
   (near field=plot distance=10 'teenage vampire')

```
not

Syntax: (not boost=N EXPRESSION)

Excludes a document if it matches the specified expression. (Boolean NOT operator.) The
expression can contain any of the structured query operators, or a simple search string. Search
strings must be enclosed in single quotes.

The boost value is a positive numeric value that increases the importance of this part of the
search query relative to the other parts.

Example:
```
   (not (or actors:'Harrison Ford' year:{,2010]))

```
or

Syntax: (or boost=N EXPRESSION1 EXPRESSION2 ... EXPRESSIONn)

Includes a document if it matches any of the specified expressions. (Boolean OR operator.) The
expressions can contain any of the structured query operators, or a simple search string. Search
strings must be enclosed in single quotes.

The boost value is a positive numeric value that increases the importance of this part of the
search query relative to the other parts.

Example:
```
   (or actors:'Alec Guinness' actors:'Harrison Ford' actors:'James Earl Jones')

```
phrase

Syntax: (phrase field=FIELD boost=N 'STRING')

Searches a text or text-array field for the specified phrase. If you omit the field option,

Amazon CloudSearch searches all statically configured text and text-array fields by default.

Search API Version 2013-01-01 332


-----

Dynamic fields and literal fields are not searched by default. You can specify which fields you

want to search by default by specifying the q.options `fields option.`

Use the phrase operator to combine a phrase search with other search criteria in a structured

query. For example q=(and (term field=title 'star') (range field=year
```
  {,2000])) matches all documents that contain star in the title field and have a year value less

```
than or equal to 2000.

The boost value is a positive numeric value that increases the importance of this part of the
search query relative to the other parts.

Example:
```
   (phrase field=plot 'teenage girl')

```
prefix

Syntax: (prefix field=FIELD boost=N 'STRING')

Searches a text, text-array, literal, or literal-array field for the specified prefix

followed by zero or more characters. If you omit the field option, Amazon CloudSearch

searches all statically configured text and text-array fields by default. Dynamic fields and
```
  literal fields are not searched by default. You can specify which fields you want to search by

```
default by specifying the q.options `fields option.`

Use the prefix operator to combine a prefix search with other search criteria in a structured

query. For example, q=(and (prefix field=title 'sta') (range field=year
```
  {,2000])) matches all documents that contain the prefix sta in the title field and have a year

```
value of less than or equal to 2000.

The boost value is a positive numeric value that increases the importance of this part of the
search query relative to the other parts.

**Note**

To implement search suggestions, you should configure and query a suggester, rather
than performing prefix searches. For more information see Suggestion Requests.

Example:

Search API Version 2013-01-01 333


-----

```
(prefix field=title 'star')

```

range

Syntax: (range field=FIELD boost=N RANGE)

Searches a numeric field (double, double-array, int, int-array) or date field (date, date-array) for
values in the specified range. Matches documents that have at least one value in the field within

the specified range. The field option must be specified.

Use the range operator to combine a range search with other search criteria in a structured

query. For example q=(and (term field=title 'star') (range field=year
```
  {,2000])) matches all documents that contain star in the title field and have a year value of

```
less than or equal to 2000.

To specify a range of values, use a comma (,) to separate the upper and lower bounds and
enclose the range using brackets or braces. A square bracket, [ or ], indicates that the bound is
included in the range, a curly brace, { or }, excludes the bound. You can omit the upper or lower
bound to specify an open-ended range. When omitting a bound, you must use a curly brace.

Examples:
```
   (range field=year [1990,2000])
   (range field=year {,2000])
   (range field=year [1990,})

```
term

Syntax: (term field=FIELD boost=N 'STRING'|VALUE)

Searches the specified field for a string, numeric value, or date. The field option must be

specified when searching for a value. If you omit the field option, Amazon CloudSearch

Search API Version 2013-01-01 334

**Simple Search Syntax**

You use the Amazon CloudSearch simple search syntax to define search criteria when using

the simple query parser. The simple query parser is used by default if you do not specify the
```
q.parser parameter.

```
You use the simple query parser to search for individual terms or phrases. By default, all statically

configured text and text-array fields are searched. Dynamic fields and literal fields are

_not searched by default. You can use the q.options parameter to specify which fields you want_
to search, change the default operator used to combine individual terms in the search string,

or disable any of the simple parser operators (and, escape, fuzzy, near, not, or, phrase,
```
precedence, prefix, whitespace).

```
For more information about using the simple query parser, see text.

Search API Version 2013-01-01 335


-----

+ (and)

Syntax: +TERM

Requires the specified term. To match, documents must contain the specified term.

Example: +star

\ (escape)

Syntax: \CHAR

Escapes special characters that you want to search for. You must escape the following
characters if you want them to be part of the query: + - & | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ /.

Example: M\*A\*S\*H

~ (fuzzy)

Syntax: TERM~N

Performs a fuzzy search. Append the ~ operator and a value to a term to indicate how much
terms can differ and still be considered a match.

Example: stor~1

~ (near)

Syntax: "PHRASE"~N

Performs a sloppy phrase search. Append the ~ operator and a value to a phrase to indicate
how far apart the terms can be and still be considered a match for the phrase.

Example: "star wars"~4

- (not)

Syntax: -TERM

Prohibits the specified term. To match, documents must not contain the term.

Example: star -wars

| (or)

Syntax: |TERM

Search API Version 2013-01-01 336


-----

Makes the specified term optional.

Example: star |wars

"..." (phrase)

Syntax: "PHRASE"

Performs a search for the entire phrase. Can be combined with the ~ operator to perform a
sloppy phrase search.

Example: "star wars"

(...) (precedence)

Syntax: (...)

Controls the order in which the query constraints are evaluated. The contents of the inner-most
parentheses are evaluated first.

Example: +(war|trek)+star

- (prefix)

Syntax: CHARS*

Matches documents that contain terms that have the specified prefix.

Example: sta*

##### Search Response

When a request completes successfully, the response body contains the search results. By default,

search results are returned in JSON. If the format parameter is set to xml, search results are
returned in XML.

Unless you explicitly specify the return parameter, the document ID and all returnable fields
are included for each matching document (hit). The response also shows the total number of

hits found (found) and the index of the first document listed (start). By default, the response

contains the first 10 hits. You specify the size parameter in your request to control how many

hits are included in each response. To page through the hits, you can use the start or cursor
parameter. For more information, see Paginate the results.

Setting the response format only affects responses to successful requests. The format of an
error response depends on the origin of the error. Errors returned by the search service are
always returned in JSON. 5xx errors due to server timeouts and other request routing problems
are returned in XML. When a request returns an error code, the body of the response contains
information about the error that occurred. If an error occurs while the request body is parsed and
validated, the error code is set to 400 and the response body includes a list of the errors and where
they occurred.

#### Submitting Suggest Requests in Amazon CloudSearch

You submit suggest requests via HTTP GET to your domain's search endpoint at 2013-01-01/
```
suggest. For information about controlling access to the suggest service, see configure access

```
policies.

Submitting Suggest Requests API Version 2013-01-01 342


-----

You must specify the API version in all suggest requests and that version must match the API
version specified when the domain was created.

For example, the following request gets suggestions from the search-movies```
rr2f34ofg56xneuemujamut52i.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com domain for the

```
query string oce using the suggester called title.
```
 http://search-imdb-hd6ebyouhw2lczkueyuqksnuzu.us west-2.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/suggest -d"q=oce&suggester=suggest_title"

```
You can use any method you want to send GET requests to your domain's search endpointâyou
can enter the request URL directly in a Web browser, use cURL to submit the request, or generate
an HTTP call using your favorite HTTP library. You can also use the Search Tester in the Amazon
CloudSearch console to get suggestions. For more information, see Searching with the Search
Tester.

**Important**

A domain's document and search endpoints remain the same for the life of the domain.
You should cache the endpoints rather than retrieving them before every upload or

search request. Querying the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service by calling aws
```
   cloudsearch describe-domains or DescribeDomains before every request is likely

```
to result in your requests being throttled.

By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns the response in JSON. You can get the results formatted

in XML by specifying the format parameter, format=xml. Setting the response format only
affects responses to successful requests. The format of an error response depends on the origin
of the error. Errors returned by the search service are always returned in JSON. 5xx errors due to
server timeouts and other request routing problems are returned in XML.

#### Suggest

##### Suggestion Requests

-----

Default: json

Required: No

##### Suggest Response

When a request completes successfully, the response body contains the suggestions. By default,

suggestions are returned in JSON. Set the format parameter to xml to get the results in XML.

Setting the response format only affects responses to successful requests. The format of an
error response depends on the origin of the error. Errors returned by the search service are
always returned in JSON. 5xx errors due to server timeouts and other request routing problems
are returned in XML. When a request returns an error code, the body of the response contains
information about the error that occurred. If an error occurs while the request body is parsed and
validated, the error code is set to 400 and the response body includes a list of the errors and where
they occurred.

The following example shows a JSON response to a request for suggestions:
```
 {
  "status": {
    "rid": "qOSM5s0oCwr8pVk=",
    "time-ms": 2
  },
  "suggest": {
    "query": "oce",
    "found": 3,
    "suggestions": [
     {
      "suggestion": "Ocean's Eleven",
      "score": 0,
      "id": "tt0054135"
     },
     {
      "suggestion": "Ocean's Thirteen",
      "score": 0,
      "id": "tt0496806"
     },
     {
      "suggestion": "Ocean's Twelve",
      "score": 0,

```

-----

```
     "id": "tt0349903"
     }
   ]
  }
}

```

The following example shows the equivalent XML response:
```
 <results>
  <status rid="/pSz580oDQr8pVk=" time-ms="2"/>
  <suggest query="oce" found="3">
    <suggestions>
     <item suggestion="Ocean's Eleven" score="0" id="tt0054135"/>
     <item suggestion="Ocean's Thirteen" score="0" id="tt0496806"/>
     <item suggestion="Ocean's Twelve" score="0" id="tt0349903"/>
    </suggestions>
  </suggest>
 </results>

#### Search Service Errors

```
A search or suggestion request can return three types of status codes:

- 5xx status codes indicate that there was an internal server error. You should catch and retry all

5xx error codes as they typically represent transient error conditions. For more information, see
Handling Errors.

- 4xx status codes indicate that the request was malformed. Correct the error(s) before

resubmitting your request.

- 2xx status codes indicate that the request was processed successfully.

The format of an error response depends on the origin of the error. Errors returned by the search
service are always returned in JSON. 5xx errors due to server timeouts and other request routing
problems are returned in XML.

Errors returned by the search service contain the following information:

error

Contains an error message returned by the search service. The code and msg properties are
included for each error.

### Uploading Documents

If your document data is not formatted correctly or contains invalid values, you will get errors
when you attempt to upload it or use it to configure fields for your domain. Here are some
common problems and their solutions:

- Invalid JSONâif you are using JSON, the first thing to do is make sure there are no JSON syntax

[errors in your document batch. To do that, run it through a validation tool such as the JSON](http://jsonlint.com)
[Validator. This will identify any fundamental issues with the data.](http://jsonlint.com)

Uploading Documents API Version 2013-01-01 348


-----

- Invalid XMLâdocument batches must be well-formed XML. You are especially likely to

encounter issues if your fields contain XML dataâthe data must be XML-encoded or enclosed in
CDATA sections. To identify any problems, run your document batch through a validation tool
[such as the W3C Markup Validation Service.](http://validator.w3.org/)

- Not Recognized as a Document Batchâif Amazon CloudSearch doesnât recognize your data

as a valid document batch when you upload data using the console, Amazon CloudSearch
generates a valid batch that contains a single content field and generic metadata fields such as
```
 content_encoding, content_type, and resourcename. Since these are not normally the

```
fields configured for the domain, you get errors stating that the fields don't exist. Similarly, if you
attempt to configure a domain from an invalid batch, Amazon CloudSearch responds with the
content and meta-data fields instead of the fields in the batch.

First, make sure that the batch is valid XML or JSON. If it is, check for invalid document IDs and
make sure you have specified the operation type for each document. For add operations, make
sure that the type, ID, and at least one field are specified for each document. Delete operations
only need to specify the type and ID. For more information about formatting your data, see
Creating Document Batches.

- Document IDs with bad valuesâA document ID can contain any letter or number and the

following characters: _ - = # ; : / ? @ &. Document IDs must be at least 1 and no more than 128
characters long.

- Multi-valued fields without a valueâwhen specifying document data in JSON, you cannot

specify an empty array as the value of a field. Multi-valued fields must contain at least one value.

- Bad charactersâone problem that can be difficult to detect if you do not filter your data while

generating your document batch is that can contain characters that are invalid in XML. Both
JSON and XML batches can contain only UTF-8 characters that are valid in XML. You can use a
[validation tool such as the JSON Validator or W3C Markup Validation Service to identify invalid](http://jsonlint.com)
characters.

### Deleting All Documents in an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

Amazon CloudSearch currently does not provide a mechanism for deleting all of the documents in
a domain.

Deleting All Documents API Version 2013-01-01 349


-----

### Amazon CloudSearch Domain Not Scaling Down After Deleting Documents

If your domain has scaled up to accommodate your index size and you delete a large number of

documents, the domain scales down the next time the full index is rebuilt. Although the index
is automatically rebuilt periodically, to scale down as quickly as possible you can explicitly run
indexing when you are done deleting documents.

### Document Update Latency

Sending a large volume of single-document batches can increase the amount of time it takes each
document to become searchable. If you have a large amount of update traffic, you need to batch
your updates. We recommend using a batch size close to the 5 MB limit. For more information, see
Creating Document Batches.

You can load up to 10,000 document batches per day (every 24 hours), with each batch size up
to 5 MB. Loading more data per day significantly increases the latency of document updates. To
mitigate this risk, you can increase your update capacity by selecting a larger instance type. For
more information, see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

### Large Number of 5xx Errors When Uploading Documents to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

If you parallelize uploads and your domain is on a search.small instance, you might experience an
unacceptably high rate of 504 or 507 errors. Setting the desired instance type to a larger instance
type will increase your update capacity and reduce the error rate. For more information about
handling 5xx errors, see Handling Errors. For information about prescaling your domain to increase
upload capacity, see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

### Search Latency and Timeouts in Amazon CloudSearch

If you are experiencing slow response times, frequently encountering internal server errors
(typically 507 or 509 errors), or seeing the number of instance hours your search domain is
consuming increase without a substantial increase in the volume of data you're searching, finetuning your search requests to reduce the processing overhead can help. For more information,
see Tuning Search Request Performance in Amazon CloudSearch. Increasing the desired replication

Domain Not Scaling Down After Deleting Documents API Version 2013-01-01 350


-----

count can also speed up search request processing. For more information, see Configuring Scaling
Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

507 and 509 errors typically indicate that your search service is overloaded. This can be due to the
volume or complexity of search requests that you are submitting. Amazon CloudSearch normally

scales automatically to handle the load. Because it takes some time to deploy additional search
instances, we recommend using an exponential backoff retry policy to temporarily reduce the
[request rate and minimize request failures. For more information, see Error Retries and Exponential](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html)
[Backoff.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html)

Certain usage patterns, such as submitting complex search queries to a single small search
instance, can sometimes result in timeouts without triggering automatic scaling. If you repeatedly
experience a high error rate, you can explicitly request additional capacity through the Amazon
[CloudSearch Service Limit Request form.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudsearch-partitions-and-instances)

### Search Latency for Faceted Queries in Amazon CloudSearch

If you are bucketing facet information with the buckets option and experiencing slow query

performance, try setting the buckets method to interval. For more information, see Bucketing
Facet Information.

### Sudden Increase in 5xx Errors When Searching an Amazon CloudSearch Domain

If your search domain experiences a sudden spike in traffic, Amazon CloudSearch responds by
adding search instances to your domain to handle the increased load. However, it takes a few

minutes to set up the new instances. You are likely to see a temporary increase in 5xx errors until
the new instances are ready to start processing requests. For more information about handling 5xx
errors, see Handling Errors. For information about pre-scaling your domain to handle an expected
spike in search requests, see Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch.

### Indexing Failures after Updating Indexing Options in Amazon CloudSearch

If you make changes to a domain's index configuration, in certain cases you might encounter Failed
to Validate errors when you run indexing. This means that the index field options you set are not
compatible with the documents that are already in your index. Specifically, you changed the type

Search Latency and Timeouts API Version 2013-01-01 351


-----

of an index field, and there are documents in your index that contain data that is incompatible

with that type. For example, this might happen if you change a literal field to an int field, and
some of your documents contain alphanumeric data in that field. When this happens, Amazon

CloudSearch sets the status of ALL fields that were being processed to the FailedToValidate

state. Rolling back the incompatible configuration change will enable you to successfully rebuild
your index. If the change is necessary, you must update or remove the incompatible documents
from your index to use the new configuration. If you can't identify the change that caused the error
or need assistance identifying the incompatible documents, contact support.

### Domain Not Found When Submitting Amazon CloudSearch Requests

You cannot access a 2013-01-01 domain with the 2011-02-01 command line tools or SDKs.
Similarly, you cannot access a 2011-02-01 domain with the 2013-01-01 command line tools
or SDKs. Make sure you are specifying the correct API version in your request and using the
appropriate command line tools or SDK.

### Number of Searchable Documents Not Returned with Domain Information

The aws cloudsearch describe-domains and DescribeDomains do not return the number
of searchable documents in the domain. To get the number of searchable documents, use the

console or submit a matchall request to your domain's search endpoint.
```
 q=matchall&q.parser=structured&size=0

### Configuration Service Access Policies Not Working in Amazon CloudSearch

```
If you have both 2011 and 2013 domains, have configured IAM policies for accessing the
configuration service, and are getting not authorized errors, note that the Amazon CloudSearch
ARN is different for the 2011-02-01 API and the 2013-01-01 API. To allow users to access both
2011 and 2013 domains, you must allow access to both ARNs in the IAM policy. For example:
```
 {
  "Statement": [

```
Domain Not Found Error API Version 2013-01-01 352


-----

```
  {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
    "cloudsearch:*",
    ],
   "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudsearch:*",
   "Resource": "arn:aws:cs:*"
  }
 ]
}

```

If your 2011 policy granted access to particular domains or actions, you must include
those restrictions in your policy. Note that the only supported action for 2011 domains is
```
cloudsearch:* and you might encounter other errors when attempting to configure resource
```
level permissions for domains created with the 2011-01-01 API.

### Search and Document Service Access Policies Not Working in Amazon CloudSearch

If you have configured access policies for you domain's search and document service endpoints,
but are getting the error 403 Request forbidden by administrative rules, it is likely due to one of the
following issues.

- Make sure the API version and resource name are specified in your requests. For example, to

upload documents with the 2013-01-01 API, you must append /2013-01-01/documents/
```
 batch to your domain's document service endpoint:
  doc-movies-123456789012.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/documents/
  batch

```
To submit search requests using the 2013-01-01 API, you must append /2013-01-01/search
to your domain's search endpoint:
```
  search-movies-123456789012.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/search?
  q=star+wars&return=title

```
To get suggestions using the 2013-01-01 API, you must append /2013-01-01/suggest to
your domain's search endpoint:

Search and Document Service Access Policies Not Working API Version 2013-01-01 353


-----

```
search-movies-123456789012.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/suggest?
q=kat&suggester=mysuggester

```


- If you are connecting from an EC2 instance, make sure the access policy specifies your EC2

instance's public IP address.

- If the machine you are connecting from is behind a router, make sure the access policy specifies

your public facing IP address.

For more information, see configure access policies.

### Amazon CloudSearch Console Permissions Errors

To access to the console, you must have permissions for the DescribeDomains action. Access
to particular domains and actions might be restricted by to the configured IAM access policies.
In addition, uploading data from an Amazon S3 bucket or DynamoDB table requires access to
those services and resources. For more information about Amazon CloudSearch access policies, see
configure access policies.

### Using Wildcards to Search Text Fields Doesn't Produce Expected Results

When you submit a search request, the text you're searching for undergoes the same text
processing so that it can be matched against the terms that appear in the index. However, no

text analysis is performed on the search term when you perform a prefix search. This means that

a search for a prefix that ends in s typically won't match the singular version of the term when

stemming is enabled. This can happen for any term that ends in s, not just plurals. For example, if

you search the actor field in the sample movie data for Anders, there are three matching movies.

If you search for Ander*, you get those movies as well as several others. However, if you search for
```
Anders* there are no matches. This is because the term is stored in the index as ander, anders

```
does not appear in the index.

If stemming is preventing your wildcard searches from returning all of the relevant matches, you

can suppress stemming for the text field by setting the AlgorithmicStemming option to none, or

you can map the data to a literal field instead of a text field.

Amazon CloudSearch Console Permissions Errors API Version 2013-01-01 354


-----

For more information about how Amazon CloudSearch processes text, see Text Processing in
Amazon CloudSearch.

### Inconsistent Results When Using Cursors for Deep Paging

When you use a cursor to page through a result set that is sorted by document score (_score),
you can get inconsistent results if the index is updated between requests. This can also occur if

your domain's replication count is greater than one, because updates are applied in an eventually
consistent manner across the instances in the domain. If this is an issue, avoid sorting the results

by score. You can either use the sort option to sort by a particular field, or use fq instead of q to
specify your search criteria. (Document scores are not calculated for filter queries.)

### Certificate Errors When Using an SDK

Because AWS SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the
AWS servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. Error messages vary,
but typically contain the following text:
```
 SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed

```
You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system
up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own
computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process.

The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions:

- Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at

least one of the required CAs in their trust list.

- Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October

2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one

of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list.

- Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6

(December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA
list.

The three certificate authorities are:

Inconsistent Results When Using Cursors for Deep Paging API Version 2013-01-01 355


-----

- Amazon Root CA 1

- Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2

- Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority

[Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from Amazon Trust Services, but](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/)
keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM[provided certificates, see AWS Certificate Manager FAQs.](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/faqs/#certificates)

**Note**

These certificates are not yet required, but are scheduled for deployment to the AWS
servers in November 2017.

## Understanding Amazon CloudSearch Limits

[This table shows naming and size restrictions within Amazon CloudSearch. You can submit a](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudsearch-partitions-and-instances)
[request if you need to increase the maximum number of partitions for a search domain. For](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudsearch-partitions-and-instances)
information about increasing other limits such as the maximum number of search domains, contact
Amazon CloudSearch.

The current Amazon CloudSearch limits are summarized in the following table.

**Item** **Limit**

Batch size The maximum batch size is 5 MB.

Data loading volume You can load one document batch every 10 seconds
(approximately 10,000 batches every 24 hours), with
each batch size up to 5 MB.

Exceeding this limit significantly increases the latency
of document updates and could result in throttling. To
mitigate this risk, you can increase your update capacity
by selecting a larger instance type. For more informati
on, see Creating Document Batches.

**Important**

No matter which instance type you select,

Amazon CloudSearch does not guarantee the
ordering of documents received in the same
second. For example, if you send three updates
with a tenth of a second between them, the
final update might not be the last one applied.
Preserving update order is yet another reason to
adhere to this limit.

Document size The maximum document size is 1 MB.

Document fields Documents can have no more than 200 fields.

Exceeding this limit significantly increases the latency of document updates and could result in throttling. To mitigate this risk, you can increase your update capacity by selecting a larger instance type. For more informati on, see Creating Document Batches. Important No matter which instance type you select, Amazon CloudSearch does not guarantee the ordering of documents received in the same second. For example, if you send three updates with a tenth of a second between them, the final update might not be the last one applied. Preserving update order is yet another reason to adhere to this limit.|
|Document size|The maximum document size is 1 MB.|
|Document fields|Documents can have no more than 200 fields.|

|Item|Limit|
|---|---|
|Expressions|â¢ Up to 50 expressions can be configured for a domain. â¢ The maximum size of an expression is 10240 bytes. â¢ The maximum value that can be returned by an expression is max(int64_t).|
|Highlighting|â¢ The maximum number of occurrences of the search term(s) that can be highlighted is 5. â¢ Highlights are only returned for the first 10 KB of data in a text field.|
|Index fields|â¢ Up to 200 index fields can be configured for a domain. A dynamic field counts as one index field, but typically matches multiple document fields. Dynamic fields can cause the total number of fields in your index to exceed 200. If you use dynamic fields, keep the number of index fields below 1,000 to avoid performance issues. â¢ Up to 1000 values can be specified in a field. â¢ Up to 20 sources can be specified for an array-type field. â¢ The maximum size of a literal field is 4096 UTF-8 code points. â¢ The maximum size of a default value for a field is 1 KB. â¢ An int field can contain values from -9,223,37 2,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). â¢ Individual terms within a text or text-array field are treated as stopwords if they exceed 256 characters.|

|Search partitions|A search index can be split across a maximum of 10 partitions. You can submit a request if you need to increase this limit. To avoid search query failures, Amazon CloudSearch domains can grow beyond this maximum partition limit, but new document additions are rejected. If you encounter this scenario, delete documents and trigger the IndexDocuments API. Alternately, request a limit increase. You can monitor the Amazon CloudWatch IndexUtil ization and Partitions metrics to take action before exceeding the maximum partition limit.|
|Search replicas|Each search partition can have up to 5 replicas. Note Enabling Multi-AZ doubles the number of replicas.|

If you have a large amount of search data, preconfig uring a domain to use more partitions can enable you to load data faster. You can also configure a domain with additional partitions to drop the per-partition document count and speed up complex queries. Amazon CloudSear ch will still scale the domain up or down based on the volume of data or traffic, but the number of partitions will never drop below your desired partition count.
